      "Title: The Guardian view on undercover policing: the struggle for accountability continues\n",
      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The public inquiry into police spies was brought about by the bravery of the women they abused, as a new documentary shows\n",
      "Article: <p>Information in the public domain about the undercover policing of protest groups from the late 1960s onwards would not be there were it not for the extraordinary courage of a group of women who were conned by officers into long-term sexual relationships. It is more than a decade since the investigation of this, and other wrongful actions, by undercover units was taken over by a judge-led public inquiry. Following revelations that officers had spied on Stephen Lawrence’s family, Theresa May, who was then the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/06/stephen-lawrence-theresa-may-inquiry-police\">ordered that inquiry</a>.</p> <p>ITV’s new three-part documentary, The Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed, made in collaboration with the Guardian, emphasises that there was nothing inevitable about this outcome. The series, which features remarkable home-video footage of one officer, Mark Jenner (known undercover as Mark Cassidy), is a gripping and shocking account of the way that five women were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/02/revealed-at-least-25-uk-spy-cops-sexual-relations-deceived-women\">tricked into romantic relationships</a> lasting years. As well as the insidious conduct of individuals, the series sheds light on the systemic nature of the abuse and the tenacity of the women who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/02/unmasking-the-spy-cops-how-women-found-the-truth-about-men-who-tricked-them-into-relationships\">uncovered&nbsp;the truth</a>. </p> <p>Undercover police, like the intelligence services, have a role to play in protecting the public from dangerous criminals. But the methods of the secret unit that these officers belonged to, the Special Demonstration Squad, were abusive and wrong – as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/nov/20/metropolitan-police-apologises-for-undercover-officers-relationships-video\">Metropolitan police admitted</a> when it settled a civil case 10 years ago. The women spied on were grossly unsuitable targets. The activists in the film were involved in non-violent leftwing protests. </p> <p>When Mark Stone (in reality Mark Kennedy) was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/09/undercover-office-green-activists\">unmasked in 2011</a>, efforts were made to present him as a “rogue officer”. But this too was false: a tradecraft manual obtained by this newspaper recommended “fleeting” relationships as a tactic. We now know that 50 or more women were manipulated into relationships by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/02/undercover-cops-deceived-people-sexual-relations\">at least 25 officers</a>, several of whom had children with partners who did not know their real names (the mother of Bob Lambert’s child learned his identity from the press).</p> <p>Whose idea was all this? Who authorised it in specific cases? Was the officer the sole conduit for intelligence or were conversations bugged? What kinds of discussions with supervisors took place when women began to speak about having children, or suffered bereavements and asked their boyfriends to attend funerals?</p> <p>Despite the inquiry, vast amounts of material remain hidden. Of the four men featured in the series, so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/undercover-police-officer-bob-lambert-deceived-women-cruel-liar-inquiry\">Lambert</a> is the only one to have testified at the inquiry. John Dines (known undercover as John Barker), with whom Helen Steel spent two years before he deserted her, has refused to appear. Last year, one officer, Trevor Morris, described the Met’s official apology to the women as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/02/met-chiefs-apology-to-deceived-women-outrageous-says-ex-undercover-officer\">outrageous</a>”. </p> <p>Years of reflecting on what happened have made these women eloquent witnesses as well as skilful detectives. Almost all the undercover officers using these tactics were men, some of them married with children. Their victims derive some satisfaction from having outsmarted the secret state. But nothing can turn back the clock or get back those stolen years and feelings. The officially sanctioned deception and abuse of multiple young women by British police officers was a disgraceful episode. It is not enough to pledge that it will never be repeated. Continued resistance to full disclosure,&nbsp;and&nbsp;accountability, must end.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Title: The Guardian view on why Canada matters: a nation in the global frontline\n",
      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Donald Trump has deliberately picked a fight with its northern neighbour. This malign strategy must be stopped\n",
      "Article: <p>It is two months since Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as Liberal party leader and Canada’s prime minister. After a decade in power, Mr Trudeau had become increasingly unpopular. Two out of three Canadians thought he was doing a bad job. The opposition Conservatives led in almost every poll. With the Liberals staring a 2025 general election defeat in the face, Mr Trudeau’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/16/chrystia-freeland-resigns-canada-trump\">ministers</a> forced him out. His successor will be chosen this Sunday.</p> <p>But then came Donald Trump. Mr Trump wants to strengthen the US at the expense of its neighbours. His hostility to Canada is thus visceral and deep. Without any justification, he promised illegal 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican imports. As a fig&nbsp;leaf for his intentions, he falsely claimed that Canada’s 5,000-mile border with the US was an open door for migrants and drugs. He talked, repeatedly and deliberately, of annexing Canada and making it the 51st state. He mocked Mr Trudeau, referring to him as merely a state governor.</p> <p>It is a malign strategy, at odds with the previous long alliance between the two nations. In Canada, Mr Trump’s aggression has backfired spectacularly. Unsurprisingly, Canadian national feeling has been turbocharged. Canadians are boycotting US goods and cancelling US holidays. The US national anthem has been booed at sports events. Mr Trudeau is quitting, but he has been giving as good as he gets in the fight against Mr Trump.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/americas/tariffs-mexico-canada-china-trump.html\">This week</a>, Mr Trump finally brought in the tariffs, in flagrant breach of the North American free trade agreement. Then, following emergency talks with manufacturers that built their businesses around the cross-border terms of that agreement, he <a href=\"https://thelogic.co/\">suspended</a> those on cars for a month the next day. Stock markets tanked on day one, but rebounded a little on day two.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2025/03/politics/transcript-speech-trump-congress-annotated-dg/\">addressing Congress</a>, Mr Trump again told outright lies about the scale of migration, drug smuggling and trade imbalances with Canada. Yet the chaos continues, with global economic implications. Further tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium are scheduled next week. It amounts to a systematic and wholly unprovoked attack on the economy and sovereignty of a peaceful and prosperous neighbour, for which there is no excuse whatever.</p> <p>Ironically, Mr Trump’s main political achievement is to have revived the Canadian Liberals, who have turned a large polling deficit around and are now <a href=\"https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/\">closing the gap</a> with Pierre&nbsp;Poilievre’s Conservatives. Whether that gap closes even further will depend partly on the choice of Mr&nbsp;Trudeau’s successor, which lies between the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland and the former Bank of England chief Mark Carney.</p> <p>The Trump onslaught also poses <a href=\"https://www.policymagazine.ca/policy-series-the-expert-group-on-canada-us-relations-on-navigating-trump-ii/\">a test</a> of judgment and patriotism for all western Conservative parties, and certainly for Canada’s. An election contest that was previously about the incumbent Liberals’ record has been transformed into one about who is best placed to stand up for Canadian sovereignty. Mr Trump’s unpopularity is the central election issue. Mr Poilievre has been slow to adjust. This week he suggested, with all the sensitivity of Liz Truss, that the answer to the tariffs&nbsp;was to <a href=\"https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/03/04/opinion/conservative-leaders-trump-tariff-test\">cut taxes</a>.</p> <p>Mr Trump has overturned Canadian politics as&nbsp;well as the international order. As a result, in the&nbsp;worldwide battle to protect a rules-based trading system, and to defend an international order based on respect for sovereignty, it is Canada&nbsp;that&nbsp;finds itself in the frontline.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The chancellor-elect’s proposals for gamechanging spending on defence and infrastructure are the right response to a new era\n",
      "Article: <p>Three days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, created a £100bn special fund to modernise Germany’s armed forces. Vladimir Putin’s aggression, he <a href=\"https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/regierungserklaerung-von-bundeskanzler-olaf-scholz-am-27-februar-2022-2008356\">told</a> a stunned Bundestag in explanation, meant that Europe was living through a <em>Zeitenwende</em>, or turning point.</p> <p>Mr Scholz was right. But it has taken the return of Donald Trump to the White House to lay bare the full scale of the emerging threat to European values, security and economic interests. For leaders across the continent, the dawning realisation of what Trump 2.0 means for the transatlantic alliance constitutes a second historic moment of jeopardy and decision.</p> <p>Crucially, Mr Scholz’s centre-right successor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, appears ready to act accordingly. Mr Merz won February’s snap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/23/who-is-friedrich-merz-and-whats-in-his-in-tray\">election</a> on a manifesto that would have boxed in state spending on both defence and a stagnating economy. But on Tuesday he <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/germanys-fiscal-u-turn-could-be-a-game-changer-for-the-countrys-sluggish-economy-analysts-say.html\">U-turned</a> to quite spectacular effect, unveiling a proposal to change Germany’s Basic Law to permit huge debt-financed investment in the military and the economy.</p> <p>In a famously cautious political culture, Mr Merz’s bid to bypass legal restrictions on government debt represents a <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/schwarz-rote-finanzplaene-gut-dass-merz-sein-wahlversprechen-bricht-kommentar-a-0ccf8e94-6d70-4e25-acbe-00b7a63144b7\">seismic shift</a>. It would permit a step-change in defence spending for years to come, putting Germany in a leadership position as Europe seeks strategic autonomy from the United States.</p> <p>This would not, however, come at the expense of vital investment in other areas. The proposed deal, if passed by the outgoing Bundestag next week, would also incorporate Social Democratic party (SPD) demands for spending on economic and social infrastructure. This would be channelled through a €500bn special fund, also to be financed by borrowing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/who-is-friedrich-merz-germany-next-chancellor-scholz-merkel\">Mr Merz</a>, a former investment banker, has been a deficit hawk and economic liberal throughout his career. It is an irony of fate that it should fall to him to challenge the debt-aversion that has hobbled Germany’s ability to react to new geopolitical realities. But the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader should be congratulated for having the political courage to read the signs of the times.</p> <p>Across Europe, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpw2zydnv7lo\">poorly performing</a> economies and a lack of investment have fuelled distrust in mainstream politics, and contributed to the dangerous rise of the Trumpian far right. In Germany, the constitutional “debt brake” – in effect a legal requirement to balance budgets – was originally conceived as a means of protecting younger generations from the consequences of risky borrowing. In these tumultuous times, amid multiple costly challenges, it has instead become an obstacle to investing in their future.</p> <p>Other leaders should take note – not least in Britain, where the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lpjqg2mp5o\">appears likely</a> to double down on her self-imposed fiscal rules in this month’s spring statement. Thursday’s EU summit in Brussels is expected to license greater national spending on defence. But for a new era characterised by threats at home and abroad, a sea change in the EU’s overall approach to debt and deficits, similar to that agreed by Mr Merz with the SPD, is needed.</p> <p>Echoing the words of the former European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi, during the eurozone crisis, Mr Merz <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/316ef73e-cf54-4d38-af5b-7166c684a13a\">pledged</a> on Tuesday to do “whatever it takes” to protect freedom and peace. He will need the support of the Greens, as well as the SPD, to push his gamechanging proposals through. It is in the overwhelming interests of Germany and Europe that he gets it.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> A pan-Arab coalition resists US-Israeli policy on Gaza, while Donald Trump’s reported Hamas talks signal a potential reversal of longstanding strategy\n",
      "Article: <p>Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/israel-cuts-off-humanitarian-supplies-to-gaza-as-it-seeks-to-change-ceasefire-deal\">decision</a> to block aid to Gaza, as ceasefire talks falter, is a devastating blow to 2 million hungry, vulnerable civilians in the shattered territory. As the occupying power, Israel is legally bound to allow relief into Gaza under the Geneva convention. Denying it isn’t just inhumane – it’s a <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.au/israels-blockage-of-aid-into-gaza-is-a-crime-against-humanity-and-violation-of-international-law/\">war crime</a>. But Benjamin Netanyahu already faces an international criminal court <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157286\">arrest</a> warrant for “starvation as a method of warfare” and “crimes against humanity”.</p> <p>Mr Netanyahu’s ability to flout international law is thanks to Donald Trump, who remains firmly in his corner. Washington now appears to accept starvation as an Israeli bargaining chip to pressure Hamas into accepting a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgz7p85mdgo\">US-devised</a> truce extension – one that secures hostage exchanges while ensuring Israeli forces remain in Gaza. Hamas, which sparked the war with its 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/06/the-guardian-view-on-a-year-of-civilian-slaughter-in-the-middle-east-a-region-in-flames\">massacre</a> of Israeli civilians, insists Israel honour its commitment to a second phase of Gaza <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/03/father-of-hostage-still-in-gaza-accuses-netanyahu-of-stalling-hamas-deal\">ceasefire</a> negotiations – ending the fighting and withdrawing troops.</p> <p>Palestinians in Gaza are on the brink. Food is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mideast-gaza-israel-hamas-war-latest-03-05-2025-a681a03e2950a89e70eb006f0c27fc3b\">running</a> out, hospitals are unable to function and families scavenge for clean water. Any further aid restrictions will turn desperation into catastrophe. It would be far better for a negotiated peace to be worked out that would see the Palestinians stay to rebuild their lives and for the remaining Israeli hostages to return home.</p> <p>After 15 months of war, and having achieved many of its declared objectives, Israel is no closer to peace in Gaza. That view is echoed by <a href=\"https://dialogueinitiatives.org/the-unreality-of-day-after-scenarios-for-gazans/\">Scott Atran</a> of Paris’s Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, who polled civilians in Gaza in January, shortly before the ceasefire came into effect. Prof Atran correctly argues that Israel lacks a political strategy for Palestine’s future and is only fuelling Palestinian anger.</p> <p>From the outset, the Trump administration has pursued an aggressive, unilateral approach to Gaza, aligning firmly with Israeli interests while disregarding Palestinian concerns. According to <a href=\"https://dialogueinitiatives.org/the-middle-east-at-a-crossroads-again/\">Nabeel Khoury</a>, a former US state department official, the Abraham accords – Mr Trump’s flagship Middle East initiative – remain central to Washington’s evolving strategy, one that envisions Israeli territorial consolidation and unchallenged regional dominance.</p> <p>Mr Khoury has noted the US’s immediate priority is the wholesale removal of Palestinians from Gaza, followed, if conditions permit, by a gradual takeover of the West Bank. That vision coincides with the Washington visit of Israel’s far-right finance minister, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/smotrich-heads-to-us-as-trump-expected-to-make-statement-on-west-bank-annexation/\">Bezalel Smotrich</a>, a pro-annexationist who has warned Mr Netanyahu that he would collapse the government if Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza under a truce.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/egypt-proposes-53bn-gaza-rebuild-as-alternative-to-trump-plan\">Arab-led plan</a> for Gaza’s post-war reconstruction – allowing its 2 million residents to remain – was rebuffed by the US and Israel. Yet it marked an important show of force: a pan-Arab coalition pushing back against the visible Netanyahu-Trump effort to erase Palestinian self-determination. In contrast, reports suggest the Trump administration is in <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/us-hamas-talks-gaza-war-israel\">direct talks</a> with Hamas.</p> <p>If true, this would be a striking reversal of US policy. Engaging Hamas – once deemed untouchable – as a US negotiating partner might be pragmatic realism, an example of Trumpian transactional diplomacy or both. The UN <a href=\"https://unctad.org/news/unrealized-potential-palestinian-oil-and-gas-reserves\">estimated</a> in 2019 that oil and natural gas resources in the occupied Palestinian territories could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for development.

The west rallied to Ukraine’s support at equally remarkable speed.</p> <p>Now, as the Trump administration turns upon the victim, and embraces the aggressor, Europe is accelerating nascent plans to bolster Ukraine and pursue security independence. Trump allies blame Friday night’s extraordinary Oval Office confrontation between Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Donald Trump and JD&nbsp;Vance for the shocking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/us-military-aid-ukraine-pause-trump-zelenskyy-updates\">halt to all US military aid</a>. Others suspect that the administration was seeking a pretext for the suspension. Mr Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1896948147085049916\">pledged</a> on Tuesday to “work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts” and<em> </em>expressed gratitude for his first-term approval of Javelin missile defence systems sales.</p> <p>That may or may not be enough. The suspension concluded a fortnight in which Mr Trump attacked Mr&nbsp;Zelenskyy as a “dictator”, the US sided with Russia against western allies at the UN, and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/chuck-schumer-russia-putin-cyber-threats\">suspended</a> offensive cyber operations against Moscow. There are reports that the US is preparing plans for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/white-house-seeks-plan-possible-russia-sanctions-relief-sources-say-2025-03-03/\">loosening the economic pressure</a> on Russia – even as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/higher-prices-trump-tariffs\">imposes punitive tariffs</a> on allies. Little wonder the Kremlin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/kremlin-us-foreign-policy-pivot-largely-coincides-vision\">crows</a> that Washington “largely coincides with our vision”. Vladimir Putin has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/iran-putin-to-help-trump-broker-nuclear-talks-with-tehran\">reportedly offered to mediate</a> US-Iran nuclear talks. Observers were braced for further developments in the US president’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/trump-state-of-the-union-address\">address to Congress</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>Analysts suggest that Ukraine’s forces should be able to continue fighting at their current rate for a few months if US aid does not resume, depending on what it has stockpiled. Though it is far less dependent on the US than three years ago, key elements like Patriot air defence missiles will be hard to replace. If US logistical and intelligence assistance and Elon Musk’s Starlink’s services were suspended, those would be further punishing&nbsp;blows.</p> <p>Mr Trump is in a hurry – hence his angry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/trump-zelenskyy-end-russia-ukraine-war\">threat</a> that Mr Zelenskyy “won’t be around very long” if he doesn’t cut a deal. This came after the Ukrainian president suggested on Sunday that the end of the war was “very, very far away”. Yet he has also squandered leverage he might have exerted on Moscow before reaching the table. He has emboldened Russia to pursue further territorial gains, especially if it can shape a deal with the US <a href=\"https://samf.substack.com/p/the-great-crisis\">before a ceasefire</a>.</p> <p>The US has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-peace-talks-ukraine-key-takeaways-london-summit\">undermined</a> central pillars of Sir Keir Starmer’s approach – maintaining military support for Kyiv and economic pressure on Moscow, and creating a “coalition of the willing” to guarantee Ukrainian security. Mr Vance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/04/uk-mps-condemn-deeply-disrespectful-jd-vance-comments\">derided</a> “20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”, then claimed that he&nbsp;was not referring to Britain or France.</p> <p>European leaders must continue trying to buy time, deferring further US perfidy, and hasten rearmament for themselves and Ukraine. On Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/eu-plan-to-bolster-europes-defences-could-raise-800bn-for-ukraine\">a proposal</a>, including changes to EU fiscal rules, which she said could mobilise nearly €800bn for defence spending. A rival operator to Starlink is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4cc04f0-5ccf-44d8-b5c1-f3eebc9cd55b\">in talks</a> with European leaders about satellite services.</p> <p>But this is an administration which moves abruptly and erratically. Ukraine and Europe are racing against the clock, not knowing when zero hour will arrive. It is likely to be sooner rather than later.</p>\n",

      "Article: <p>After last Friday’s disgraceful roughhouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript\">treatment</a> of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, delivered a pithy summary of first principles regarding the first full-scale&nbsp;war between nation states on European soil since 1945. “There is an aggressor: Russia,” Mr Macron <a href=\"https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1895582703556444404\">observed</a> on social media, “There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago – and to keep doing so.”</p> <p>That this needed saying underlines the extent to which Donald Trump’s administration is laying waste decades-old assumptions governing transatlantic relations. Appearing to prioritise a reset of the US relationship with Russia over international law and the unity of the west, Mr Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-realignment-the-geopolitical-plates-are-moving-brace-for-further-shocks\">pursuing</a> a peace deal with Moscow on Vladimir Putin’s terms. At the same time he is seeking to plunder Ukraine’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn527pz54neo\">natural resources</a>, while demanding obeisance and gratitude from Kyiv in return.</p> <p>For the sake of Ukraine, which has fought with such bravery for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2025/feb/24/three-years-of-war-in-ukraine-in-pictures\">three years</a> to resist Mr Putin’s illegal invasion, and for the sake of its own future security interests, Europe’s response needs to be unified, robust and ambitious. In that respect, the London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-peace-talks-ukraine-key-takeaways-london-summit\">defence summit</a> convened by Sir Keir Starmer on Sunday was a&nbsp;useful start, but multiple uncertainties remain.</p> <p>The bullying and taunting of Mr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office meant the conference rightly became an occasion for a counter-display of emotional solidarity, embodied in the bear-hug the Ukrainian president received from Sir Keir in Downing Street. Substantively,&nbsp;however, Europe’s strategy for dealing with an unpredictable and ideologically hostile White House is a work in progress.</p> <p>Alongside much-needed commitments to boost military assistance to Ukraine, Sir Keir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-europe-crossroads-history-must-support-ukraine\">announced</a> that a “coalition of the willing” would be created to deter Russian violations of any future peace deal. By presenting their own <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-britain-propose-partial-one-month-ukraine-truce-macron-tells-le-figaro-2025-03-02/\">plans</a> for a ceasefire, significantly increasing defence spending, and pledging “boots on the ground” to police a peace agreement, European leaders aim to persuade Mr&nbsp;Trump to offer the US security guarantees that are indispensable if such a force is to be deployed.</p> <p>For this balancing act to have a chance of success, as yet unidentified Nato members will need to step up alongside Britain and France with substantial troop contributions, and relations between Kyiv and Washington will need to be patched up. Achieving the latter will be anything but easy. But Mr&nbsp;Zelenskyy’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cvg1v97rr8qo\">affirmation</a> on Sunday that he remained willing to sign a minerals deal with Mr Trump represented a recognition of this grim necessity.</p> <p>The prospect of Kyiv being bounced unwillingly into a ceasefire without guarantees, as Mr&nbsp;Trump licenses a territorial carve-up to reward Mr&nbsp;Putin’s murderous aggression, is intolerable. Through diplomacy in Washington, but also through military&nbsp;assistance on a scale that will require more&nbsp;flexible <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a70537d-2756-4243-8c97-a279c6cb227a\">fiscal rules</a> in Brussels and in national&nbsp;capitals, Europe must build on the London&nbsp;summit to give Ukraine agency and a voice&nbsp;in determining its own destiny.</p> <p>More broadly, the evidence <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250303-trump-downplays-worrying-over-putin-rapprochement\">mounts</a> that as Mr&nbsp;Trump seeks to forge a new understanding with Mr Putin’s revanchist regime, he is indifferent to the impact on European security and interests. As Sir Keir commented at the close of Sunday’s summit, Europe stands “at a crossroads”. Strategic autonomy, and far greater sovereign capability, will be needed to navigate the challenging route ahead.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Title: The Guardian view on Labour and the NHS: there is no miracle cure for a struggling health system\n",
      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Wes Streeting is building a team of reformers, but ingrained weaknesses in the health service will be hard to fix\n",
      "Article: <p>Speaking to MPs last week, Dr Penny Dash quoted the Guardian’s description of her as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/25/wes-streeting-to-axe-thousands-of-jobs-at-nhs-england-after-ousting-of-chief-executive\">reforming zealot</a>. Dr&nbsp;Dash is less zealous than she used to be, she said, and better at listening. But the doctor and management consultant, who has just been appointed chair of NHS England, has lost none of her determination to make the health service better and more productive.</p> <p>How this boost will be achieved is the multibillion-pound question. The upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/keir-starmer-nhs-plan-key-elements-will-it-succeed\">10-year plan</a> is Wes&nbsp;Streeting’s chance to turn Labour’s manifesto pledges, and consistent poll lead on the NHS, into policies that could help his party win a second term. </p> <p>But the conditions in which he must do this are hugely challenging. The UK has an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/18/european-countries-experience-life-expectancy-slowdown-research-shows\">ageing and increasingly ill population</a>, and a health system which, while it performs reasonably well compared with other countries, has ingrained weaknesses. Some of these are to do with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/03/one-in-three-nhs-doctors-so-tired-their-ability-to-treat-patients-is-affected-survey-finds\">workforce</a>, with shortages in some areas and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/23/nurses-reject-government-pay-award-england\">dissatisfaction with pay</a> that makes further strikes likely.</p> <p>Long-term underinvestment means technology and infrastructure are not what they should be. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/17/improving-social-care-big-task-talks-good-place-start\">lack of social care provision</a>, and failure by successive governments to tackle this, adds significantly to pressure on GPs and hospitals. Since health is devolved, most of Mr Streeting’s decisions affect only England directly, though many of the problems are the&nbsp;same – notably long waiting lists and population health issues, including obesity.</p> <p>In broad terms, Mr Streeting has already set out his reforms. These involve three shifts: from analogue to digital, from hospitals to community, and from treatment to prevention and public health. But conjuring up a vision of change is easier than delivering it, or persuading staff and the public to believe it can work.</p> <p>Technology is the easy bit, although plenty of things could still go wrong. Mr Streeting’s recent announcement that the new GP contract will include <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd7ee895nr0o\">more online booking</a>, and the continued rollout of the NHS app, are modernisation measures&nbsp;that make obvious sense. Health tech businesses are eager partners, though campaigners are right to point to the risks of allowing them to access the NHS’s unique datasets.</p> <p>Moving healthcare from hospitals to neighbourhood and community settings is an even trickier proposition. It is one thing to endorse this as a concept. But with hospitals under huge pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/05/cash-incentives-for-gps-under-labours-radical-plan-to-cut-nhs-waiting-lists\">waiting lists</a>, restive staff and a lack of investment, there is certain to be conflict over the extent to which spending is redirected away from the acute trusts that now absorb the <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/where-does-the-nhs-money-go\">majority of health budgets</a> (59% of the total in England in 2022-23).</p> <p>In an ideal world, new local services would be built up in parallel to existing ones. This is known as “double running”, but costs money that no one expects to be forthcoming. Hence the high hopes placed in efficiency savings, including recently announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/25/wes-streeting-to-axe-thousands-of-jobs-at-nhs-england-after-ousting-of-chief-executive\">cuts to NHS England itself</a>.</p> <p>Of course, clarity about who does what is desirable, and duplication of roles between civil servants should be avoided. Ambiguities about the&nbsp;remit of integrated care boards need to be ironed out. But how to allocate resources, and whether the NHS’s priorities are really going to be reoriented towards prevention, are political decisions that, in the end, will be taken by ministers. Change is far more likely to be incremental than sudden. The truest words Dr Dash spoke to MPs were when&nbsp;she&nbsp;said “this is hard”.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Donald Trump’s threats to global tax reform have backfired, leaving the US isolated as nations push ahead with a new UN tax convention\n",
      "Article: <p>Donald Trump’s Oval Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war\">tirade on Friday</a> laid bare his instinct to harangue and bully those – even supposed allies such as Ukraine, fighting for its survival&nbsp;– who dare to disagree. Countries pushing global tax reform at the UN will be watching as US demands for subjugation play out in plain sight. His <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-declares-oecd-tax-deal-has-no-force-or-effect-us-2025-01-21/\">day-one threat</a> to punish nations taxing US firms is an all-out attack on global fiscal cooperation. If multilateralism in taxation was already on shaky ground, Mr Trump’s return could bury it for good.</p> <p>Under discussion is a new UN tax convention that may permit states to tax economic activity where it actually occurs, rather than allowing multinationals to shift profits to tax havens. The Tax Justice Network (TJN) said last year that nations lose <a href=\"https://taxjustice.net/reports/the-state-of-tax-justice-2024/\">$492bn</a> (£390bn) annually due to corporate tax abuse. The global south bears the greatest losses, which undermine public services like health and education. If enacted, the convention would create a legally binding framework requiring multinationals to pay tax where they employ staff and do real business – not where they stash profits. This would replace the outdated arm’s-length principle with unitary taxation, ensuring fair profit allocation. It would mean an end to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_17_3701\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-apple-amazon-google-and-tax-avoidance-schemes-idUSBRE94L0J7/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/14/how-eu-landmark-apple-tax-ruling-gave-ireland-13bn-euros-it-didnt-want\">Apple</a> putting billions through lower-tax jurisdictions while extracting wealth from higher-tax ones.</p> <p>Before Mr Trump’s election, about half of global tax losses were facilitated by the <a href=\"https://www.cesr.org/convention-conclusion-unpacking-the-final-week-of-un-tax-convention-negotiations/\">eight nations</a> opposed to a UN tax convention – Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the UK and the US. Yet opposition takes two forms: constructive and destructive. When negotiations for the UN framework convention on international tax cooperation began <a href=\"https://taxjustice.net/2025/02/05/trumps-walkout-fumble-is-a-golden-window-to-push-ahead-with-a-un-tax-convention/\">last month</a>, all participants committed to the convention’s principles except Mr Trump’s delegate, who walked out in defiance, calling on others to follow. The expected exodus never came. Washington was left isolated. Mr&nbsp;Trump’s “America first” became “America alone”.</p> <p>But the US still has tremendous clout. As TJN’s new <a href=\"https://taxjustice.net/reports/the-international-tax-consequences-of-president-trump/\">report</a>, The International Tax Consequences of President Trump, highlights, talks among 120-plus nations on taxing cross-border digital services – led by the US-dominated OECD – are grinding towards a showdown. Mr Trump’s tariff threats against <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ca/Documents/tax/en-pillar-two-AODA.pdf\">Canada</a> and the EU are warning shots, aimed at countries daring to raise tax rates on multinationals, especially US ones. This fight isn’t just about taxation; it’s about sovereignty. Mr Trump’s administration is trying to strong-arm nations into preserving a system that shields corporate profits from fair taxation. The difference now is that the world is pushing back.</p> <p>For decades, the US has had an unofficial veto over global tax rules, using its heft to shape – and then <a href=\"https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/oecd-to-keep-working-with-us-despite-trumps-rejection-of-tax-deal/\">reject</a> – OECD-led proposals. But this approach is no longer sustainable. The growing coalition behind the UN tax convention shows that many governments prefer to chart their own course. Mr Trump’s return forces a stark choice: stick with a broken system that fuels tax abuse or push forward without the US. Any attempt to tax multinationals fairly will face American retaliation, but clinging to the OECD’s US-dominated framework is a dead end.</p> <p>A united front at the UN is needed to forge a global&nbsp;tax system not dictated by Washington’s whims. The <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/07/31/treaty-banning-cluster-munitions-turns-10-without-us\">cluster munitions convention</a> succeeded without US involvement, proving international norms can shift without it. The world doesn’t need US approval to fix global taxation. It needs the will to move forward together.</p>\n",

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Bold pledges to fund climate projects now appear under threat, exposing deeper fiscal constraints and policy dilemmas within the government\n",
      "Article: <p>In October, the prime minister, chancellor and energy secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/labour-to-commit-almost-22bn-to-fund-carbon-capture-and-storage-projects\">pledged</a> billions to kickstart the UK’s first carbon capture projects – one of the biggest green spending promises of the parliament. By December, Ed&nbsp;Miliband was signing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/contracts-signed-for-uks-first-carbon-capture-projects-in-teesside\">contracts</a>, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to “reignite our industrial heartlands” and Rachel Reeves warned that without bold action, Britain&nbsp;would be stuck with low growth and falling living standards. More importantly, net zero targets wouldn’t be met without removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. </p> <p>Fast forward and the Treasury is, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9d2f3ad-b58f-4e8a-ab7c-01a132e79709\">reportedly</a>, preparing to scrap the £22bn plan, after economic growth failed to materialise. What a difference a few&nbsp;weeks make.</p> <p>The change of heart is not about the technology – carbon capture and storage (CCS) is still as underdeveloped as it was in October, when ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/04/keir-starmer-clean-energy-plans-new-technologies\">extolled</a> its virtues. The government’s climate advisers are unequivocal: net zero is impossible without CCS. But the economic circumstances have changed. Ms&nbsp;Reeves underestimated how slowly interest rates would fall, and the deep spending pressures left by Tory austerity. She also faces rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-defence-spending-bold-ideas-needed-to-have-guns-as-well-as-butter\">defence</a> costs.</p> <p>Her rigid, self-imposed fiscal rules dictate that any higher-than-expected spending in one area must be offset by cuts elsewhere. Rather than such arbitrary constraints, Britain needs a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/20/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-spend-politics-dodging-debate-by-fiddling-with-fiscal-rules\">transparent system</a> that enables strategic investment. The good news is that the Climate Change Committee told the government <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/The-Seventh-Carbon-Budget.pdf\">last week</a> that the net cost of cutting UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 to 100% below 1990 levels is now 73% lower than it previously thought in 2020. The bad news is that the transition would still require a net cost of around <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/ccc-reducing-emissions-87-by-2040-would-help-cut-household-costs-by-1400/\">£4bn</a> a year, a little under 0.2% of GDP.</p> <p>With less fiscal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/28/cutting-waste-or-more-tax-how-reeves-could-appease-obr-in-spring-statement\">headroom</a> than forecast, Ms&nbsp;Reeves could close the gap through borrowing or with a modest wealth tax – but rejects both. That leaves an unpalatable choice: cuts to welfare, public services or growth-driving investment in housing, energy and transport. <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/rachel-reeves-interview-labour-963sw6jbk\">Diverting</a> funds from capital projects to defence risks turning her growth agenda into the usual Tory mix of deregulation, austerity and national security. </p> <p>Greening Britain requires short-term expenditure for long-term gains. Reaching net zero requires upfront investment, but will <a href=\"https://x.com/DrSimEvans/status/1894695530774573264\">lower consumer bills</a> and reduce reliance on imported fuels, shielding the population against price shocks. Early, targeted&nbsp;spending is a cost-saving measure – delays lead to higher long-term spending due to climate-related disasters, economic disruption and energy price instability. While private investment will eventually play a dominant role, the climate committee makes it clear that public spending remains necessary in areas where market forces alone can’t drive change fast enough.</p> <p>Labour must recognise the state’s crucial role in the green transition. BP’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/26/bp-oil-and-gas-spending-green-energy-scale-back\">retreat</a> from renewables proves private firms can’t be trusted to phase out fossil fuels. A Common Wealth <a href=\"https://www.common-wealth.org/publications/public-coordination-of-a-just-north-sea-transition\">report</a> is clear: profit-driven companies prioritise extraction over climate action. In January, it argued public ownership is the only credible way to manage the £43bn North&nbsp;Sea decommissioning costs while ensuring a just transition. While it must be carefully managed to avoid inefficiency, public control remains the best way to phase out fossil fuels fairly and smoothly. The UK can’t rely on foreign supply chains for green tech, or corporate goodwill to deliver net zero. Without a serious state-led green strategy, Labour’s plan risks falling short of the challenge Britain faces.</p>\n",

The signs are that the event on Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood may produce scene-stealing of a similar lasting nature. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many feel a celebration of overpaid actors is not what Los Angeles should be hosting in the wake of its devastating fires</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There’s enough going on in the best actress category alone to suggest that it would be a major disappointment if the competition passed without embarrassing incident. </p> <p>Consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/karla-sofia-gascon\">Karla Sofía Gascón</a>, who was well placed to exploit the sentimental and novelty votes as the first out trans woman to be nominated in the category for her role in <em>Emilia Pérez</em>.</p> <p>That was until old social media comments emerged in which she derided the prominence of ethnic minority actors at the 2021 Oscars. She was duly dropped from the film’s promotion, leaving her about as likely to make the podium as Smith is to be placed in charge of security.</p> <p>Not that her fellow nominee Fernanda Torres will be packing her winner’s speech with any more confidence. The star of <em>I’m Still Here</em> had to issue a self-excoriating mea culpa when a 17-year-old clip from a Brazilian comedy show in which she wore blackface just happened to surface during the awards&nbsp;season. </p> <p>And before Mikey Madison, star of <em>Anora</em>, rushes the stage to bag the vacant award, it should be recalled that she was the subject of another rumpus after admitting that she didn’t use an intimacy coach in her sex scenes with co-star Mark Eydelshteyn. </p> <p>Throw in the stink around the best film nominee <em>The Brutalist</em> for its use of AI on best actor nominee Adrien Brody’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/20/the-brutalist-and-emilia-perezs-voice-cloning-controversies-make-ai-the-new-awards-season-battleground\">Hungarian accent</a>, and that many feel that a celebration of overpaid actors is not what Los Angeles should be hosting in the wake of its devastating fires, and there are the necessary preconditions for a long night of toe-curling viewing. </p> <p>All of which adds up to an ideal way to mark this juncture in our history. For Hollywood’s highest calling is its role as the world’s dream factory. </p> <p>If the films it produces fail to capture the imagination, then it should at least provide by way of distraction from a collapsing world order an evening of exquisite&nbsp;discomfort. </p> <p>When military spending goes up and global aid goes down, it’s time to focus on the important things in life: ancient tweets, bad comedy clips and the bedside choreography of a promising young actress. </p> <p>Yes, there are wars and tariffs and existential threats aplenty.

      "Subheading: With or without the US, Europe must learn to defend itself, and Ukraine, against Russian aggression\n",
      "Article: <p>The treatment of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, by the US president, Donald Trump, during what appears to have been a staged confrontation in the White House in front of the world’s press, marks one of the most profoundly shocking moments in US diplomacy in decades.</p> <p>In this crass and deeply disturbing performance, the wartime leader of a democratic European country that is fighting against an illegal invasion by Russia, which has seen its citizens killed and cities bombed indiscriminately, was subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript\">a vicious, ignorant and mendacious attack</a> that was designed to humiliate.</p> <p>Many watching the antics of Trump and his vice-president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/jd-vance-volodymyr-zelenskyy\">JD Vance</a> – and the subsequent cheerleading from their far-right political allies – will have been sickened by what they saw: an American president channelling the words of Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. In the cold light of the day that has followed, the world – and Europe in particular – has woken to the most uncomfortable of realities.</p> <p>The US, the country that has styled itself the indispensable nation, has aligned itself with the enemies of peace and democracy. If “America first” marks simply a shattering moment of US isolationism not seen since the run-up to America’s entry into the Second World War, this would be devastating enough. But, as they gather in London tomorrow, European leaders, Keir Starmer among them, must recognise that the contours of European and global security have been transformed.</p> <p>The first lesson should be acknowledgment of what has been obvious since Trump’s inauguration: the US cannot be relied on as a security, intelligence or trading partner. Washington’s underpinning of Nato, and international security, is no longer a given. By giving succour to a Russia already conducting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/04/up-to-100-suspicious-incidents-in-europe-can-be-attributed-to-russia-czech-minister-says\">hostile acts against European countries</a> beyond Ukraine, including Britain, Trump has made common cause with the greatest threat facing Europe today.</p> <p>That was reflected in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/28/european-leaders-throw-support-behind-zelenskyy-after-heated-trump-meeting\">comment by Kaja Kallas</a>, the EU’s foreign policy chief, after Friday’s degrading White House spectacle, that the “free world needs a new leader”. In practical terms, that must mean an end to the pretence that Trump can be flattered and played.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is important to take stock of the reality with which the world is confronted, not the fantasy some would wish to see</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The almost unanimous outpouring of support from European leaders for Zelenskyy and Ukraine after the White House meeting needs to be swiftly followed by a show of unity at the London summit – and by concrete measures to support Ukraine and to preserve the wider peace on the European continent.</p> <p>All of which means hard decisions will need to be made, and quickly, in European capitals, not only on defence spending but in recognising and in communicating to the public that a wider conflict with Russia – and without US support – is not unthinkable but must be actively prepared for.</p> <p>For, while it is easy to see Trump’s actions as the petulant, theatrical and narcissistic reaction of a deeply insecure individual, the consequences go far beyond that. If there is a glimmer of hope, no matter how dim, it is that Trump’s poisonous bluster is underpinned by incoherence and weakness that is open to being&nbsp;challenged.</p> <p>It is important to take stock of the reality with which the world is confronted, not the fantasy some would wish to see. Washington’s abdication of leadership and support for Ukraine requires a rapid and united European response without caveats.</p> <p>As Kallas suggests, that requires European leaders to articulate the values to which they are committed and how they will practically back them, including material aid to Kyiv. Because the Trump administration’s often bizarre and self-harming view of foreign and trade policy, merging unilateralism, territorial expansion and isolationism, can only work in our deeply connected world if other countries allow it to.</p> <p>America, as Zelenskyy rightly observed, is as vulnerable to Putin’s acts as Ukraine and Europe. Starmer’s visit to Washington last week – following that of the French president, Emmanuel Macron – was a necessary attempt to influence Trump. That effort has failed and it should be clear that there are now red lines, the most obvious of which is the threat to end US aid to Kyiv. After Friday’s events, it is already highly questionable in many minds whether Trump should be granted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-trump-visit-relations\">state visit to the UK</a>.</p> <p>What should be clear to No 10 is that ending aid to Ukraine would be a step too far for the UK, even for this highly abnormal regime in Washington. Above all, Starmer and other European leaders must insist on the primacy of one of the key founding principles of the post Second World War order, enshrined in international law: territory may not be acquired through military aggression.</p> <p>The starting point for any peace in Ukraine must be to recognise the illegality of Putin’s aggressions, which began with the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine should have a seat at the table in all discussions, free from threats and extortion from Trump and his allies. The aim of those discussions should be to see both the full withdrawal of Russian forces and powerful guarantees for Kyiv’s security. At this moment of dark reckoning, we owe it not only to the people of Ukraine; we owe it to ourselves.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So much for Mr Trump’s remark that “I’m in the middle, I’m for both Ukraine and Russia” – itself a shameful pronouncement. It is hard to see how the curtailed visit – Mr Trump said that Mr Zelenskyy “can come back when he is ready for peace” – could have gone worse. “President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Mr Trump wrote.</p> \n",
      "<p>Europe’s charm initiative was always a long shot. Like Mr Macron, Sir Keir enjoyed a jovial reception from Mr Trump. He had learned to speak his language. Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/keir-starmer-trump-us-uk-relationship\">arrived armed with an invitation</a> for a second state visit, he gushed that Donald Trump’s return to Britain would be “so incredible. It will be historic.” He also managed to speak the truth: he stressed that peace must not reward the aggressor and factchecked the president’s lie that European aid to Ukraine was merely loaned. Asked about Mr Trump’s vision for Gaza, he stated the need for Palestinians to return home and reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to the two-state solution.</p> \n",
      "<p>Mr Trump, in affable mode, suggested he would probably back the UK’s plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He dangled the prospect of a bilateral trade deal, but its substance remains unclear – and likely skewed in America’s favour.</p> \n",
      "<p>It would have been folly for Sir Keir to burn bridges. But it was always clear that Mr Trump would be ready to set the torch to them himself whenever he saw fit. And so on Friday he put the boot into a democratically elected leader fighting to defend his country against invasion – “You don’t have the cards,” he told Mr Zelenskyy – yet has said he believes that Mr Putin can be trusted to keep promises. No one else does, which is why a security backstop from the US is needed.</p> \n",
      "<p>The minerals <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-biden-minerals-ukraine.html\">deal</a> that Kyiv was set to sign with Washington smacks more of a shakedown than a partnership.

Sir Keir Starmer’s decision to cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending was wrong. Making the world’s poorest foot the bill for Britain’s security is reckless and&nbsp;self-defeating. Slashing aid fuels instability – it won’t&nbsp;buy&nbsp;safety. From her perch in government Ms Dodds, who was Sir Keir’s first shadow chancellor, knew&nbsp;this better than most.</p> <p>The former cabinet minister’s letter is right to warn that the cuts will mean the UK withdrawing from many developing countries and having a diminished role in global institutions like the World Bank, the G7 and climate negotiations. She pointedly argued Britain will find it “impossible” to deliver on its commitment to maintain development spending in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine with the shrunken budget. Sir Keir rebuffed this charge, but Ms Dodds is right to say his move is being seen as following the Trumpian lead in cutting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-usaid-cuts\">USAid</a> – a framing that implies the UK is losing its independent foreign policy direction.</p> <p>Like many others, including this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-defence-spending-bold-ideas-needed-to-have-guns-as-well-as-butter\">column</a>, she understood that in an increasingly volatile world, defence spending must rise. But rather than a collective discussion on whether the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/20/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-spend-politics-dodging-debate-by-fiddling-with-fiscal-rules\">fiscal rules</a> and tax policies remain fit for purpose, the prime minister chose to gut aid budgets to fund defence spending with little debate, as if stability abroad weren’t essential to security at home. Such high-handed treatment left Ms Dodds, a soft-left intellectual politician, with no choice but to resign.</p> <p>Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/28/anneliese-dodds-soft-left-intellectual-pushed-to-resign-over-starmers-slide-right\">departure</a> had been in the air since Sir Keir made his announcement – but she held off until he returned from Washington. Sir Keir now owns the decision, and its consequences will define his leadership. That he was shaped by events rather than shaping them will not be lost on his MPs.</p> <p>Clive Lewis, a leftwing Labour MP and former soldier, has called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/28/keir-starmer-donald-trump-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-67c1ba5b8f089e8672a04657#block-67c1ba5b8f089e8672a04657\">wealth tax</a> to fund defence.&nbsp;This is a sensible idea that merits wider discussion, as does relaxing borrowing rules – a debate already under way in <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/eu-leaders-ask-eib-to-review-lending-rules-issue-defence-debt/\">Europe</a>. The party’s right wing wants to frame Sir Keir’s move as more than fiscal, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/starmers-new-resolve-will-open-rifts-in-labour-8jmwccqpr\">briefing</a> that Sir Keir has made a deliberate break from the party’s pro-aid stance. It is reported that the Treasury didn’t push this – it was the prime minister’s personal call. Ms Dodds’ rise and fall mirrors his hardening leadership style.</p> <p>Sir Keir is seizing this crisis to remake his party. His government has embraced militarisation, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5gpyv4dnwo\">welfare cuts</a>, climate <a href=\"https://theweek.com/business/economy/airport-expansion-is-labour-choosing-growth-over-the-environment\">backtracking</a> and nationalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/12/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-asylum-in-retreat-from-decency\">asylum</a> policies. The political rationale is to ward off attacks from the extreme right and particularly Reform, which has seen its support rise. Why amplify rightwing narratives instead of challenging them? If this is just tactical positioning, fine. If not, he risks losing Labour’s soul – a perilous path as concerns over the lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/aug/29/uk-graduates-struggle-job-market\">good jobs</a>, equality, <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/two-child-benefit-cap-cuts-poverty-labour/\">child poverty</a> and pensioner support are likely to keep growing.

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> A new report makes a convincing case for outlawing strangulation imagery – and putting the home secretary in charge\n",
      "Article: <p>It is news to nobody that the internet has enabled an unprecedented explosion of pornographic material. There is widespread awareness, too, that much of this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/27/ban-pornography-depicting-strangulation-review-urges-ministers\">far more violent</a> than used to be the norm in adult sexual publishing and entertainment – with more extreme content understood to drive engagement, as it does across the internet. The UK’s Online Safety Act should block children from accessing disturbing and unsuitable content. It is shameful that age-verification legislation took so long. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-a-safer-world-the-challenge-of-regulating-online-pornography\">independent report</a> on pornography delivered to ministers this week ought to be the next step in a national effort to deal with the proliferation of online sexual violence. As Peter Kyle, the science secretary, said on Thursday, it is an authoritative piece of work. When he meets its author, Gabby Bertin, next week, he should commit to act on her recommendations. Draft guidance from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/25/ofcom-calls-on-tech-firms-to-step-up-action-against-revenge-porn\">Ofcom</a>, regarding material currently defined as legal but harmful, is under consultation. But Lady Bertin is right to demand that ministers go further. While clear-sighted about the disproportionate harms to women, she notes, too, the dangers to boys and men, and highlights the prospect that problematic pornography use could be classed as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/02/secret-lives-of-porn-addicts-i-am-meticulous-about-covering-my-tracks\">addiction</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/response-to-the-independent-review-of-pornography-letter-to-baroness-bertin/letter-to-baroness-bertin-government-response-to-the-independent-pornography-review\">initial response</a> from ministers suggests that making strangulation pornography illegal will, rightly given the associated risks, be prioritised. This is one of several areas in which the gap between the rules governing online and offline content is both wrong and illogical. Material that is illegal to distribute in physical form (in films or DVDs) ought to be prohibited online as well. It is shocking that payment processors such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/19/pornhub-abuse-videos-new-york-times-mastercard-visa\">Visa and Mastercard</a> have, until now, been the closest thing there is to a regulator of the vast online pornography industry. The goal is not blanket censorship, but preventing harmful content from being produced, promoted and easily accessed, especially by minors.</p> <p>Ministers’ reiteration of pledges to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/11/labour-deepfake-porn-bill-government-keir-starmer\">ban deepfake nude images</a> and strengthen the law on intimate image abuse is also welcome. So is the acknowledgment that police tracking and recording of online sexual offences need to be improved, partly to increase understanding and evidence of links with “real life” violence. Even with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/17/the-guardian-view-on-online-safety-ministers-must-stand-up-to-big-tech\">Online Safety Act</a> in place, the current laws dating back to the Obscene Publications Act are inadequate and poorly enforced. Statutory codes as well as legislation could be used to close loopholes. The government’s commitment to halve violence against women and girls must point to a more robust overall approach. Measures to protect performers should include a new right to withdraw consent – meaning that pornographic content would be taken down.</p> <p>The existence of pornography <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/dec/16/online-incest-porn-is-normalising-child-abuse-say-charities\">categories including incest</a>, step-incest and “teens”, points to dark aspects of sexuality that many people would rather ignore – and partly explains the extraordinary laxness with which the industry is treated. The safety by design measures in the Online Safety Act must be used to compel businesses to stop promoting material that is harmful but not illegal.</p> <p>Regulation of the sex industry is an international issue as well as a domestic one. But Lady Bertin directs her challenge to the home&nbsp;secretary, Yvette Cooper, in particular. For&nbsp;too long, she argues, pornography policy has been dispersed across government, leaving no one fully in charge. The review makes a powerful case&nbsp;that&nbsp;Ms&nbsp;Cooper&nbsp;should take it on.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Article: <p>After four decades of violence that have claimed at least 40,000 lives, this was a momentous declaration. On Thursday, the leader of the Kurdish insurgency, Abdullah Öcalan, revered by his supporters, called on fighters to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/27/pkk-leader-calls-on-kurdish-militant-group-to-disarm-signalling-start-of-fragile-peace-with-turkey\">lay down arms</a>. In a written statement from his prison cell – he has been held in isolation for a quarter of a century – he urged his Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) not only to disarm but to dissolve itself.</p> <p>Yet optimism must be tempered. Ten years ago, a two-year truce between the militant group and the Turkish state imploded and some of the worst violence of the long conflict ensued. <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/turkiyes-pkk-conflict-visual-explainer\">More than 7,000 people</a>, including hundreds of civilians, have died since then.</p> <p>That attempt at a deal with a group designated by both Turkey and its western allies as a terrorist organisation came amid a very different political context, before the contours of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s illiberal democracy were so clear. The need to end the violence endures. The difference is that this time, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/27/why-has-pkk-leader-called-on-group-to-dissolve-and-why-does-it-matter-turkey-abdullah-ocalan\">peace efforts</a> are driven by <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/winds-change-ankaras-subtle-shifts-towards-reconciliation-kurdish-elements-turkey\">both domestic politics</a> and regional developments.</p> <p>In October, President Erdoğan’s hardline ally Devlet Bahçeli, who once called for the execution of the PKK leader, surprised observers by suggesting that his life sentence might be reconsidered if he told fighters to disarm. Mr Erdoğan’s ambitions to continue in office despite Turkey’s term limits are clear: he has generously indicated that he would be open to running again “if the people want it”. But this would require either early elections or a change to the constitution. In either case, he would need support from legislators beyond his coalition – perhaps from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy party (DEM).</p> <p>The Middle East’s instability also <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2024/10/turkey-pkk-ocalan-offer-terror-attack-why?lang=en\">strengthened Turkey’s desire</a> for security solutions. Then, just over a month after Mr Bahçeli’s call, Bashar al-Assad unexpectedly fell from power in Syria – thanks in part to Turkey’s backing of the victorious rebels, Hayat Tahrir-al Sham. The US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/21/drones-are-above-our-heads-kurdish-led-sdf-fights-for-survival-in-syria\">fighting to maintain</a> the autonomous region they established in north-east Syria, aware that Donald Trump’s return to the White House is unlikely to be helpful. Iraq’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-iraq-push-reset-ties-cooperation-against-pkk-2024-04-22/\">warming relations with Turkey</a> have seen an agreement to work together to counter the PKK.</p> <p>That has left the PKK feeling isolated. This time, it looks as if the motivation on the Kurdish side is less about potential gains than the hope of a reprieve from military pressure and, in Turkey, from political pressure on the DEM, which has had several mayors removed and municipalities investigated – part of a broader pattern of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/02/13/a-new-crackdown-is-gathering-strength-in-turkey\">increasing repression</a>.</p> <p>The PKK’s demands long ago morphed from an independent Kurdish homeland to greater autonomy in Turkey and more rights for Kurds, who account for as much as a fifth of the country’s population. Yet a deal may not necessarily bring much progress on these more modest demands. Ankara may prefer economic inducements: it recently announced a development plan for the Kurdish-majority south-east.</p> <p>One question is whether thousands of PKK fighters – mostly outside Turkey itself now – will be persuaded. Another is the cost to the Kurds and Turkey. After so many deaths and so many false starts, moves towards peace must be welcomed. But the price should not be the indefinite extension of the president’s strongman rule, and any lasting resolution would surely require proper democratic representation for Kurds, as they are demanding.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The prime minister must handle Donald Trump with tact, but without flinching from a duty to confront falsehoods in the president’s worldview\n",
      "Article: <p>It is hard to set expectations ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/24/starmers-meeting-with-trump-will-be-pms-biggest-diplomatic-test-to-date\">a summit</a> with no useful precedent. British prime ministers have visited the White House before and in a wide variety of geopolitical contexts, but never has the hosting president been hostile to the transatlantic alliance. Never before could it be said that Washington’s foreign policy regarding European security was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/trump-ukraine-war-russia-could-have-made-a-deal\">closer to a Moscow line</a> than a London one.</p> <p>Conventional platitudes about a “special relationship” and common values are of little use to Sir Keir Starmer in handling Donald Trump. History is not&nbsp;irrelevant, but on matters of substance – most urgently, a settlement to end the war in Ukraine – Mr Trump is behaving more like a mafia boss than a statesman. His method is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/what-are-ukraines-critical-minerals-and-why-does-trump-want-them\">demand tribute</a> in exchange for protection.</p> <p>Sir Keir’s challenge is to engage with the US president on his own terms, while cajoling him towards a more sophisticated understanding of events – one that includes the concept of an ongoing US interest in Nato and the security of European democracies. The prime minister’s pledge this week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-slashes-aid-to-fund-major-increase-in-defence-spending\">raise UK defence spending</a>, regrettably financed with an ill-judged transfer of resources from overseas development aid, is&nbsp;a key step in that tactical manoeuvre.</p> <p>Mr Trump’s scorn for Nato comes from the view, shared to some degree by previous US administrations, that Europeans use the alliance to freeload on the Pentagon’s resources. Advertising Britain as a nation that is stepping up to pay its way might buy some traction in the conversation about Ukraine’s future. Sir Keir will also want to reinforce the message, delivered to the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/macron-meeting-with-trump-prompts-cautious-optimism-about-ukraine-peace-talks\">earlier this week</a> by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that Russia cannot be trusted to honour any deals that don’t include a significant deterrent against further aggression by Moscow.</p> <p>This has to be framed in terms of American strength and Mr Trump’s personal glory. The president must see his own interests clearly illuminated in viable alternatives to a dirty deal struck in haste with Vladimir Putin, over the head of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on terms that trade away Ukrainian sovereignty.</p> <p>Sir Keir should argue that American prestige and commercial opportunity will only be available if a deal is sustainable. That means, in the short to medium term at least, security guarantees for Ukraine that Europe alone is not yet equipped to provide. He must find the angle where UK national interests and Mr Trump’s personal vanity coincide.</p> <p>It is a grubby business. The US president often says things that are blatantly false. He is famously sensitive to contradiction. Sir Keir will not want to inflame the presidential temper, but he must also stand up for reality against wilful disinformation. He has rebutted Mr Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/ukraine-zelenskyy-says-trump-living-in-russian-disinformation-bubble\">misrepresentation of Mr Zelenskyy</a> as a “dictator” and his denial of Russian responsibility for the war. That message is easier to deliver in statements from Downing Street than to the president’s face as a guest of the White&nbsp;House. It will require considerable tact.</p> <p>Sir Keir has to be realistic about the new and dangerous character of US foreign policy, but realism doesn’t equate to cynical accommodation with Mr&nbsp;Trump’s caprice. Alongside the ethical imperative, the UK has a strategic interest in facts forming the basis of international diplomacy. Speaking truth to a superpower gone rogue, in public and in private, is an indispensable part of the prime minister’s mission.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial: </strong>Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist-led government has welcomed immigration and boosted public spending, with stellar results\n",
      "Article: <p>Coverage of this week’s seismic election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/feb/23/german-election-2025-results-in-full-live\">result</a> in Germany focused on the disturbing rise of the far right, and chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/merzs-conservatives-push-quick-coalition-talks-after-german-election-win-2025-02-24/\">warning</a> that Europe can no longer rely on the United States for its security. But for European progressives, there was also a third depressing takeaway: the comprehensive rejection of Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party, which&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;its worst postwar result.</p> <p>Across the continent, centre-left parties have been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cw4433yz73vo\">exiled</a> from the corridors of power, while the radical right has fuelled anxieties over immigration and economic stagnation to extend its influence. There is, however, one startling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/how-spains-radically-different-approach-to-migration-helped-its-economy-soar\">outlier</a> to this dismal trend. Last year, Spain <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spains-economy-outperforms-eurozone-2024-with-32-growth-2025-01-29/\">recorded</a> the highest growth of any major country, at 3.2%. This was achieved under a Socialist-led coalition government that has welcomed high levels of immigration as a driver of economic prosperity, and which from this year plans to <a href=\"https://schengen.news/spain-to-grant-residency-work-permits-to-900000-undocumented-migrants-in-the-next-3-years/#google_vignette\">offer</a> residency and work permits to up to 900,000 undocumented migrants. In 2024, over 400,000 vacancies were filled by migrants and dual nationals, as overall unemployment figures fell to their <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250128-spain-jobless-rate-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2008-crisis\">lowest level</a> since the 2008 crash.</p> <p>The case for migration in a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the European Union – forcefully made by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez – has been complemented by a commitment to generous public spending that is also at odds with the zeitgeist. Boosted by EU post-pandemic recovery funds, levels of government expenditure reached an <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-spending\">all-time high</a> at the end of last year. Most of the money has gone on upgrading vital infrastructure and green investment, including urban low-emission zones and subsidies for&nbsp;small businesses.</p> <p>On the European stage, too, Spain is blazing a progressive trail. As crucial negotiations over future EU spending begin, Madrid has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-pushes-double-eu-budget-over-e2-trillion-debt-borrowing-scheme/\">proposed</a> a doubling of the next seven-year budget, financed by joint borrowing mechanisms pioneered after Covid. In an era in which spending on defence risks diverting resources away from other public goods and the green transition, Mr Sánchez is right to argue that more Europe, not less, should be part of the solution.</p> <p>Panglossian hyperbole should be avoided. An important factor boosting Spain’s growth has been the booming tourist industry, which is creating <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy19egx47eo\">tensions</a> in cities and resorts hollowed out by Airbnb. A related housing crisis urgently needs to be addressed. And interpreting to what extent impressive GDP figures translate into general wellbeing is far from straightforward.</p> <p>Nevertheless, at a time when much of the mainstream centre-left appears to have lost faith in progressive political solutions, the Sánchez government’s achievements deserve to be celebrated. A robustly social democratic approach to economic renewal, and a recognition of what migrants can offer ageing societies, remains the best response to the rise of nationalist, xenophobic politics.</p> <p>When unveiling his government’s plans to make it easier for migrants to settle last October, Mr Sánchez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/pedro-sanchez-unveils-plans-to-make-it-easier-for-migrants-to-settle-in-spain\">commented</a>: “Throughout history, migration has been one of the great drivers of the development of nations, while hatred and xenophobia have been – and continue to be – the greatest destroyer of nations. The key is in managing it well.”</p> <p>It has become vanishingly rare to hear political leaders not only making such an argument but also acting on it. This may be a moment of maximum hubris for the Trumpian right across the west. But Spain continues to show that there is another way.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Labour’s ‘pragmatism’ isn’t neutral – it locks the party into fiscal caution, reinforcing stagnation and fuelling the very instability it seeks to avoid\n",
      "Article: <p>Politics is about choices. Some are forced on governments by circumstance. Others are self‑imposed. Labour’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-planning-big-cuts-to-aid-budget-to-boost-defence-spending-say-sources\">decision</a> to cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending is firmly in the latter category. It is also wrong –&nbsp;forcing the world’s poor to pay for Britain’s safety. This is a false economy. Cutting aid will make the world more unstable, not less. The very crises that fuel conflict – poverty, failed states, climate disasters and mass displacement – will only worsen with less development funding. Labour’s logic is self‑defeating:&nbsp;diverting money from aid to defence does not buy security; it undermines it.</p> <p>The numbers tell the story. Despite government attempts to inflate the <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/ifs-response-defence-spending-announcement\">amounts</a> involved, the extra <a href=\"https://archive.ph/pSnyq\">£5bn‑£6bn</a> for defence is tiny relative to Britain’s GDP. The UK could easily absorb this through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-defence-spending-bold-ideas-needed-to-have-guns-as-well-as-butter\">borrowing</a> –&nbsp;especially in a global financial system where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/the-guardian-view-on-andrew-baileys-aggression-whatever-traders-think-is-true-becomes-fact\">sterling</a> is heavily traded – or, if the government prefers, through a modest wealth tax. Yet Sir Keir Starmer has chosen to frame this as a zero-sum game, where aid must give way to security. Why? Because this is not about economic necessity – it’s about political positioning. Labour wants to prove that it can be fiscally disciplined even when the numbers don’t demand it. It wants to neutralise <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyrkkv4gd7o\">Tory attacks</a>, even when the real battle is over priorities, not affordability.</p> <p>It is also a move that aligns with Donald&nbsp;Trump’s worldview. The US president wants to close down the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyezjwnx5ko\">US government’s main overseas aid agency</a>, treating it as an expensive indulgence rather than a pillar of foreign policy. Sir Keir is set to go to Washington this week. A UK prime minister that echoes Mr Trump’s “America first” instincts on defence and aid may find the meeting more congenial. If so, Sir Keir may be taking the idea that “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2kplgqTdq9scsd6pLXXYTZj/adrian-chiles\">the meek shall inherit the earth</a>” a little too literally.</p> <p>Labour doesn’t just believe in fiscal discipline, it believes that it must believe in fiscal discipline and it constructs a justification for that belief. The problem is this: by accepting Conservative trade‑offs, Labour locks itself into an orthodoxy that it may later need to break. In a volatile world, Britain –&nbsp;outside the EU – must boost high-value exports and cut reliance on fragile supply chains. Even under Joe Biden, the UK was kept out of the <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/useuttc\">US-EU Trade and Technology Council</a>, which strengthened transatlantic industrial policy. Yet when does Downing Street admit Britain’s real limit is productive capacity – not budget deficits?</p> <p>Britain’s fiscal constraint is artificial, but its resource constraints are real. Energy, food and manufacturing are matters of national security, not just market functions. Without investment, dependence on key imports makes Britain vulnerable to supply-chain shocks and price inflation. That should make the announcements by Labour’s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/energy-secretary-ed-miliband-calls-energy-price-cap-increase-worrying-13316609\">Ed Miliband</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/23/labour-hopes-to-heal-rift-with-farmers-with-public-sector-food-targets\">Steve Reed</a> matter. If every pound spent requires a cut elsewhere, neither would have had much to say.</p> <p>Sir Keir often presents himself as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue – claiming to be adapting to circumstances rather than adhering to dogma. But such pragmatism is itself a belief system, one&nbsp;that treats capitalism’s rules as unchangeable, markets as beyond politics, and history as a one‑way street where past mistakes justify permanent, crippling caution. In doing so, he isn’t just rejecting alternatives – he’s rewriting history to suggest they were never an option to begin with.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Article: <p>The rumblings prompted by Donald Trump’s re-election soon gathered force. First came tariffs and threats of territorial annexation; then the greater shocks of JD Vance’s Valentine’s Day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-stuns-munich-conference-with-blistering-attack-on-europes-leaders\">massacre of European values</a> and Mr Trump’s enthusiastic amplification of Kremlin lines on Ukraine.</p> <p>On Monday came another seismic moment. For more than a decade, the UN security council has been largely <a href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm22078.doc.htm\">paralysed</a> by the split between the five permanent members – Russia and China on one side; the US, France and Britain on the other. This time, when the US brought a resolution calling for an end to the war in Ukraine on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion, it did not criticise Moscow, demand its withdrawal or back Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The result was that China and Russia backed the resolution – while the UK and France, having failed to temper it, abstained.</p> <p>Earlier, even Beijing had <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5161380-ukraine-un-resolution/\">chosen to abstain</a> rather than reject a UN general assembly resolution condemning Moscow as the aggressor in Ukraine. It was passed overwhelmingly, with the backing of 93&nbsp;states. Yet the US joined Russia in voting against it – along with Belarus, North Korea, Syria and a handful of others. “These are not our friends,” the Republican senator John Curtis <a href=\"https://kslnewsradio.com/shows-podcasts/utahs-morning-news/sen-curtis-discusses-concern-over-us-vote-against-un-resolution-condemning-russia/2186999/\">wrote</a> on X.</p> <p>The post-1945 order is beyond repair while Mr&nbsp;Trump occupies the White House. Emmanuel Macron’s charm and deftness papered over the problems somewhat when he became the first European leader to meet the US president since his re-election. (Sir Keir Starmer, not noted for his nimbleness or charisma, is likely to find the task somewhat harder this week.) The French president was adroit in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-whisperer-us-europe-relations\">flattering Mr Trump</a> even as he told the truth. But it is not surprising that he failed to make any real progress in closing the gap. These are not cracks in the transatlantic relationship, but a chasm.</p> <p>A committed Atlanticist such as Friedrich Merz, on course to shortly become the German chancellor, is compelled to urge independence from the US because “the Americans, at any case the Americans in this administration, do not care much about the fate of Europe”. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/friedrich-merz-germany-europe-independence-from-us\">warned</a> that European leaders might not be able to talk about Nato in its current form by June. The problem is not only what Mr&nbsp;Trump may do but what he may not. Nato is built on the conviction that countries will stand by the commitments they make. That confidence cannot exist while Mr Trump is president.</p> <p>When Sir Keir told MPs on Tuesday that “Here we are, in a world where everything has changed”, he was commenting on Russian aggression, but everyone understood the real shift underlying his remarks. To note, as he did, that the US-British alliance has survived countless external challenges was not quite a vote of confidence. It tacitly acknowledged that the threat this time is internal.</p> <p>The ground is rocking beneath Europe’s feet. It must brace itself for further shocks. In place of the post-second world war order, Mr Trump envisages a world where alliances are no more than empty words and great powers bluff and bully their way through. Bilateral meetings have their purpose – they may offer minimal respite and buy a little time – but it will require common will to defend the interests of European states. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, suggested that European leaders would be meeting in London at the weekend&nbsp;to discuss&nbsp;security. Their best hope of standing firm is&nbsp;by standing together.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Article: <p>Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU), has a reputation for being blunt. On Sunday evening, as it became clear that the CDU had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/23/conservatives-poised-to-win-german-election-but-far-right-afd-doubles-support\">won</a> the snap election triggered by the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, Olaf Scholz, he did not disappoint. “For me,” said Mr&nbsp;Merz in a post-election television debate, “the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.”</p> <p>As recently as a fortnight ago, such a statement from a German chancellor-elect would have been inconceivable. But these are new and extraordinary times. A convinced <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/german-election-results-2025-friedrich-merz-next-chancellor-historic-question-europe-without-us-support/\">transatlanticist</a>, Mr Merz has previously played down the dangers to western unity posed by Donald Trump. But crude electioneering on behalf of the extreme right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) by the US president’s <a href=\"https://time.com/7260499/alice-weidel-far-right-afd-germany-musk-vance-trump/\">outriders</a>, and the sidelining of Europe and Kyiv from negotiations over the future of Ukraine, have forced a handbrake turn.</p> <p>For the European Union, as it seeks to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-merz-questions-longevity-natos-current-form-2025-02-23/\">strengthen</a> its strategic autonomy in a new and challenging era, that is good news. For Ukraine, in desperate need of robust support from a united Europe, Mr Merz’s steadfast <a href=\"https://insightnews.media/germany-merz-in-favor-of-taurus-supply-to-ukraine-but-names-a-condition/\">backing</a> also offers cause for hope. Newly assertive leadership from the EU’s most powerful member state will be key in a tangibly more menacing global context.</p> <p>Domestically, reasons for optimism are thinner on the ground. As Mr Merz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/germany-election-far-right-surge-friedrich-merz-warning\">acknowledged</a> on Monday, the weekend’s poll revealed a dangerously polarised country – one in which the centre is historically weak while the far right continues to surge, particularly in the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn02w01xr2jo\">east</a>. On a very high turnout, the AfD doubled its vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/feb/23/german-election-2025-results-in-full-live\">to 21%</a>. The combined score of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), was 29% – its second lowest since 1949. The Social Democrat party (SPD) endured its worst postwar result, reduced to third place and a miserable 16%.</p> <p>Mr Merz has pledged to maintain the firewall excluding the far right from power, and the makeup of the new Bundestag points to a two-party coalition with the SPD. That could lead to a welcome tempering of CDU <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/20/germany-s-merz-vows-tough-migrant-policy-to-stall-afd-s-rise_6738350_4.html\">efforts</a> to ape AfD stances on immigration policy. Rather than prolonging unsuccessful attempts to crowd out the far right, it would be in Germany’s interests for Mr Merz to move in the other direction on the economy.</p> <p>The CDU leader made his reputation in the 1990s as a small-state free marketeer in the Ronald Reagan mould. Yet as chancellor he will inherit a moribund economy in dire need of huge government investment, at a time when the pressure to raise defence spending is also acute. The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg5kpweqjzo\">business model</a> that depended on cheap Russian energy and Chinese demand for exports has collapsed. Fixing it may require pushing for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33b4fcfd-803f-4b39-9778-6126196736c8\">constitutional reform</a> to allow the state to borrow and spend more – anathema to many in Mr Merz’s party.</p> <p>One in five German voters opted on Sunday for a party that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62q937y029o\">supports</a> the forced repatriation of migrants and has been associated with neo-Nazi dog-whistling. Ominously, the AfD picked up substantial support among the young as well as non-graduates. Beyond the firewall, the AfD leader, Alice&nbsp;Weidel, can position herself as leader of a Trumpian government-in-waiting. The next administration must attempt to restore trust in Germany’s postwar tradition of consensus-building and moderation. The stakes could scarcely be higher.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The government’s consultation was weighted towards big tech. Now is the time for a rethink\n",
      "Article: <p>It’s a seductive promise: let our computers scrape the internet for ideas, images, forms of words, stories, music, jokes … and our industry will make your country rich. For a UK government desperate for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/21/rachel-reeves-given-smaller-than-expected-15bn-tax-boost-to-uk-finances\">economic growth</a>, the demands of tech companies for copyright laws to be relaxed – in order that their artificial intelligence (AI) systems can access as much&nbsp;online content as possible without having to pay&nbsp;or seek permission – have been hard to resist. The US and China are the global leaders of this new tech race. But the UK has a chance to compete that ministers&nbsp;are desperate not&nbsp;to&nbsp;miss.</p> <p>To AI businesses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-ai-and-copyright-law-big-tech-must-pay\">copyright</a> is an irritant. Three years ago, it appeared that their lobbyists were on the verge of getting their way when a government agency, the Intellectual Property Office, recommended an exemption for data mining. This would grant bots free rein and – so the argument went – provide an incentive for tech companies to invest in the UK.</p> <p>The proposal was not taken up. Unfortunately, it was not killed off either. And the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/copyright-and-artificial-intelligence\">consultation</a> regarding AI and copyright law being run by the current&nbsp;government, which concludes on Tuesday, is framed in terms that are far too favourable to big tech.</p> <p>Currently, the law is very clear. The makers of works of art, and other products of human creativity, including journalism, have for centuries been entitled to protection from copyists. Drawing a line between influence and imitation is not always straightforward, and can lead to interesting court cases. But the principle that original material cannot be ripped off and that creative people have rights over their work is widely understood and accepted.</p> <p>It is not surprising that big tech decided these rules did not apply to AI. Breaking things is, famously, part of the Silicon Valley ethos. Already, AI firms have absorbed a vast amount of material that they ought to have been obliged to pay for. There are parallels with the way that US social media companies built advertising-funded businesses that&nbsp;were heavily reliant on content, including news, that was paid for by others. Once again, regulators as well as other industries are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/16/the-guardian-view-on-regulating-social-media-the-internet-should-be-safer\">struggling to keep up</a>. But it is individual artists, writers and musicians, and smaller creative and media organisations and businesses, who are most in danger of being left&nbsp;behind.</p> <p>It is easy to see why ministers are attracted by big tech’s boundless self-belief. Who doesn’t hope that new technology will help to solve some of the world’s many problems? But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/11/us-uk-paris-ai-summit-artificial-intelligence-declaration\">JD&nbsp;Vance</a>, the US&nbsp;vice-president, was wrong to criticise European&nbsp;governments for being “too self-conscious, too risk-averse”, at the AI summit held in &nbsp;Paris earlier this month. It is concerning that the UK, like the US, refused to sign a declaration committed to safety and sustainability.</p> <p>Thankfully, artists including Paul McCartney and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/22/elton-john-calls-for-uk-copyright-rules-rethink-to-protect-creators-from-ai\">Elton John</a> have stepped up to make the case against big tech anti-regulation – and in favour of&nbsp;the continued protection of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/23/dont-gift-our-work-to-ai-billionaires-mark-haddon-michal-rosen-and-other-creatives-urge-government\">human artistry</a>. In the House of Lords, an amendment to the government’s data bill, asserting that licences to copyrighted material must be actively sought rather than taken for granted, was accepted. Ministers who have had their heads turned by the promise of&nbsp;new data centres and a seat at the AI table should&nbsp;reconsider&nbsp;their priorities and obligations. Big tech should have no more rights over the&nbsp;work&nbsp;of others than anybody else.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Title: The Guardian view on Labour arts policy: time to make history again\n",
      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Sixty years ago this week, Jennie Lee launched Britain’s first culture white paper. Lisa Nandy must pick up the baton\n",
      "Article: <p>The date is not in many history books. But it should be. It is 60 years on Tuesday since Britain’s first minister for the arts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/10/i-could-have-written-three-plays-about-her-jennie-lee-mp-and-wife-of-nye-bevan-is-celebrated-on-stage\">Jennie Lee</a>, published the first UK government&nbsp;white paper on the arts. The <a href=\"https://collective-encounters.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/A-Policy-for-the-Arts-Jennie-Lee.pdf\">white paper</a>, which crammed more into 18 pages than many government documents do at 10 times that length, was&nbsp;a landmark, an attempt to set out “a&nbsp;more&nbsp;coherent, generous and imaginative approach” to the arts policy this country lacked.</p> <p>The current culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has yet to publish such a white paper herself. She ought to do so. Nevertheless, last week she did the next best thing, travelling to Stratford-upon-Avon, the most iconic location on these islands in which to reflect on arts policy, to deliver an anniversary lecture in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/11/buzz-goodbody-other-place-royal-shakespeare-company\">Buzz&nbsp;Goodbody’s</a> experimental Other Place theatre.</p> <p>Today, as in February 1965, government money is tight. But Ms Nandy’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/jennie-lee-lecture-arts-for-everyone\">lecture</a> was similarly strong‑minded. “Today’s artists need more financial help,” Ms Lee stated, promising that “notwithstanding&nbsp;the difficulties of the present situation, the government propose to increase substantially their grant to the Arts Council”. There was an echo of that in Ms Nandy’s announcement of a £270m <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-investment-to-boost-growth-and-cement-britains-place-as-cultural-powerhouse\">funding package</a> to prevent further decay in Britain’s “crumbling cultural infrastructure”.</p> <p>There were deeper parallels too. Both Ms Lee and Ms&nbsp;Nandy see the school system as the unmatchable arena to nurture passion for the arts and to widen social access. “The place that the arts occupy in the life of the nation is largely a reflection of the time and effort devoted to them in schools and colleges,” wrote Ms Lee in 1965. “Culture and creativity has been erased from our classrooms,” complained Ms&nbsp;Nandy, adding: “This is madness.”</p> <p>Like Ms Lee, Ms Nandy advocates a wide national approach to an arts ecology that is too routinely London-centred. In some parts of Britain, said the 1965 white paper, “professional companies are nonexistent”, adding: “All this must change.” That same anxiety shone through Ms Nandy’s call for “reviving culture in places where it is disappearing”. The key is to level up, not level down.</p> <p>Though daunting, these are nevertheless two of the relatively straightforward challenges facing UK arts policy. In the digital and multicultural age, however, it will not be enough to invoke the iconic figure of Ms Lee and insist that if only today’s Labour government can reconnect with her example, admirable as it was, then all will be well.</p> <p>The arts ecology that she inherited was shaped by the wartime popularisation work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/06/threat-arts-government-society-political-tides\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, which led to the Arts Council in 1944. Keynes wanted the arts to become “a living element in everyone’s upbringing”. In the postwar years, the Arts Council retreated from this approach, leaving Ms Lee’s white paper to try to reverse the drift.</p> <p>Today, we must do the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/feb/23/jennie-lee-policy-arts-white-paper-funding\">same again</a>. Yet we live in changed times. Britain is more divided and disrespectful. Digital media have revolutionised the&nbsp;arts. Confidence in an inherited national culture, strong in Keynes’s day, has declined. Yet in 2025 the arts are a far larger part of the economy and of British life than in 1965. Too many past arguments destructively pitted excellence against access, when&nbsp;both must be cherished equally. Ms&nbsp;Lee always stood for excellence and access alike.&nbsp;Ms&nbsp;Nandy’s lecture suggests she knows that, in the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/11/wednesday-briefing-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-spending-review-but-were-afraid-to-ask\">spending review</a>, she will be&nbsp;fighting the same battle. She needs to win it.</p>\n",

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> As security and humanitarian conditions deteriorate even further, the community needs help\n",
      "Article: <p>A year ago, it seemed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/haiti\">Haiti</a> had hit rock bottom. Violence had exploded and conditions had deteriorated following President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination in 2021. Then, last February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/08/haiti-crisis-gang-jailbreak-explained\">gangs banded together</a> to free thousands of prisoners, besiege airports and police stations, and demand that Haiti’s unpopular replacement leader departed.</p> <p>Ariel Henry was ousted, but the nation has only spiralled further into crisis. Violence intensified again towards the end of last year. Armed criminals control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Already desperate circumstances have become much more so: more than a million people – around one in 10 of the population – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/haiti-displaced-gangs\">have now been displaced</a>, triple the level a year ago. Half are&nbsp;experiencing acute food insecurity.</p> <p>At least 5,600 people were killed in gang violence last year. The United Nations says that sexual violence against children <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjdp7m7wkdo\">has risen tenfold</a>; many are being <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/02/haiti-children-suffering-gang-recruitment-attacks-sexual-violence/\">forcibly recruited</a> into organised crime. The kidnap and murder of health workers has put around two-thirds of medical facilities out of use. Even commercial flights have largely halted after gangs <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article298286778.html\">opened fire on planes</a>.</p> <p>Amid all this, the United States announced on Thursday that it is scrapping temporary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy839m7xd1zo\">protection from deportation</a> for half a million Haitians in the US, meaning that they could be removed by August. That’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/springfield-ohio-haitian-immigrants-trump\">hardly a surprise</a> given the vile lies about Haitian&nbsp;migrants spread by President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in last year’s election. And some deportations continued even under the Biden administration. But the announcement is no less appalling for that – and all the more so given the role of the US in the nation’s troubles over the years. A country born in such hope, in the uprising of enslaved people, has never shaken off the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/14/haiti-history-earthquake-disaster\">devastating reparations</a> France imposed for its freedom and the years of foreign occupation and meddling that followed. </p> <p>Last spring was supposed to mark a turning point for the country, with the arrival of a UN-backed and largely Kenyan-staffed security support mission, and the move to a transitional government&nbsp;supposed to pave the way for elections&nbsp;next year – more than a decade after the last polls. But the council, which contains just one token representative of civil society, has been beset by self-interested struggles, and three of its nine members face corruption charges but refuse to resign. The security mission has less than half the&nbsp;personnel initially envisaged, has failed to make&nbsp;an impact, and now Mr Trump has frozen US&nbsp;funding for it.</p> <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/caribbean/haiti/107-locked-transition-politics-and-violence-haiti\">report</a> by the International Crisis Group warns that elections cannot be held safely under current circumstances, and that pressing ahead with them might fuel further violence by gangs attempting to push their cronies into power. It argues that the priority for the transitional council must be focusing on basic governance.</p> <p>Meanwhile, every possible legal avenue to extend protection from deportation for Haitians in the US must be employed. The US must do more to cut off the flow of arms in breach of the embargo. Humanitarian support for the nation, always inadequate and now hit by Trump administration cuts, must be properly backed. The UN’s 2024 appeal was less than half funded, leaving&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;people unsupported. With the need now far greater, it is asking <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/news/un-requests-900-mn-for-haiti-crisis-in-2025-fe0b98af\">for $900m</a>.

      "Subheading: Thanks to Donald Trump, a new era of great power imperialism fuelled by authoritarianism and hyper-nationalism is unfolding\n",
      "Article: <p>A torrent of abrupt US policy reversals, resets and revisions since Donald Trump returned to the White House last month has left America’s friends and enemies struggling to keep up. Trump’s desire both to upend and dominate the established international order, and in particular his undermining of the postwar <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/21/yes-america-is-europes-enemy-now/\">transatlantic alliance</a>, is feeding talk of a watershed moment akin to 1989, when the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled an end to the cold&nbsp;war.</p> <p>His behaviour has strengthened a consensus, current among western politicians, diplomats and analysts, that&nbsp;the world is reaching a turning point, that the UN-led, rules-based, multilateralist system is crumbling, and that a new era of great power imperialism fuelled by authoritarianism, hyper-nationalism and left- and rightwing populism is unfolding.</p> <p>Trump’s “America first” approach – self-interested, transactional, overtly commercial and untroubled by principled considerations of justice, international law and human rights – reflects and entrenches this changed world. When his ill-informed, consistently wrong-headed instincts collide with the harsh realities of specific international issues, problems predictably arise. Gaza is a case in point. Trump imperiously ordered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-gaza-ceasefire-hamas-hostages\">freeing of all Israeli hostages</a>, and was ignored. Then he set an arbitrary deadline, which jeopardised the fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire. He also proposed a US takeover of Gaza and the mass expulsion of Palestinians – an illegal, unworkable idea supported only by the Israeli far right. His noisy posturing makes things worse. All key issues remain unresolved.</p> <p>The incoherence and disdain for facts that characterises Trump’s approach is seen again in his handling of Ukraine. He says he wants to end the war with Russia – a laudable aim that most people share. But instead of supporting impartial, independent mediation, the US president has turned against Ukraine’s leader, Volodymr Zelenskyy, labelling him a dictator, and falsely implying that he profits from the war. Such projection is revealing. Trump’s ire stems in large part from Zelenskyy’s rejection of a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-minerals-peace.html\">$500bn minerals deal</a> Trump wants as “repayment” for US aid. He seemed at one point to issue a de facto ultimatum: “Give me the cash, or I’ll back Russia.” Facing a loss of US support, Kyiv is reconsidering the deal under duress. But the war is no closer to ending.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>With his erratic, irrational policy missteps, Trump marches up and down like the grand old Duke of York</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is much closer, to the shock and dismay of European and Nato allies, is an American rehabilitation of Russia. A 90-minute phone conversation between Trump and Vladimir Putin was followed last week by bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia, which excluded Europe and Ukraine. This outreach effectively ended Russia’s international isolation, begun after its unprovoked, illegal invasion of Ukraine three years agoon Monday. The volte-face shattered Nato and EU solidarity. Now&nbsp;a Trump-Putin summit is planned. By slandering Zelenskyy while praising Putin, an indicted war criminal&nbsp;– and making a string of ill-judged concessions – Trump upended western policy for no gain. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/15/donald-trumps-betrayal-of-ukraine-has-emboldened-vladimir-putin-and-pulled-the-rug-from-under-nato-allies\">greatly boosted Putin</a>, who, it is feared, may next turn his gunsights on Moldova, Poland or the three Baltic&nbsp;republics.</p> <p>With his erratic, irrational policy missteps, fed by personal grudges, narcissism and mercenary greed, Trump marches up and down like the grand old Duke of York. One minute he says Zelenskyy is irrelevant, the next that he and Putin must sit down and talk. Some officials, such as the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, attempt a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/rubio-russia-europe.html\">more moderate, reasoned line</a>. But they appear outgunned by hard-right figures who have the president’s ear. Europe saw this at first hand at this month’s Munich security conference, when JD Vance, the US vice-president, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-jd-vance-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-political-divisions-maga/\">declared war on European values and governing traditions</a>. A particular target was Germany, where Vance – demonstrating extreme arrogance – <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/trump-nato.html\">backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)</a> ahead of this weekend’s national elections. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s improbable defence secretary, added his tuppence-worth, warning Europe that it was no longer a strategic priority, demanding it pay more to defend itself and hinting at US troop withdrawals.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest that these attacks, when coupled with Trump’s threats to impose swingeing tariffs on Europe and seize Canada, Panama and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/31/nearly-half-of-danes-see-us-as-threat-and-78-oppose-greenland-sale-poll-shows\">Danish Greenland</a> by force, have led many to conclude that the US is now an adversary, not an ally. A gulf is opening up across the Atlantic. Vance, Elon Musk and hard-right agitators such as Steve Bannon have a vision of a Europe run not by elected liberal-progressive coalitions but by people like themselves: Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, Germany’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-alice-weidel-meeting-germany-far-right\">Alice Weidel</a>, France’s Marine Le Pen and Britain’s Nigel Farage. No matter that the vast majority of Europeans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/europeans-see-donald-trump-necessary-partner-not-ally-poll\">oppose their multiple bigotries, racism and misogyny</a>.</p> <p>It is into this chaotic, poisonous, ever-shifting world that Keir Starmer must trepidatiously step this week, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/21/starmer-trump-zelenskyy-attack-ukraine\">meets Trump in Washington</a>. Trying to make sense of it all, and repair the immediate damage, may be the height of the prime minister’s ambition. Yet he must be firm in restating Britain’s view: Ukraine is the victim, Russia is the predator; Zelenskyy is a democratically elected ally, Putin is the dictator; Russian aggression threatens all of Europe and the US, Nato must stand united in opposition; Britain will pay more for its own defence, so will the Europeans, but the US should not and must not walk away.</p> <p>To sacrifice Ukraine would be to invite worse and bigger future conflicts in Europe, eviscerate the western alliance, and encourage copycat behaviour by China and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/20/french-foreign-minister-rules-based-order-ukraine-g20\">authoritarian regimes the world over</a>.

In the United States, Donald Trump had just won a decisive victory and was promising to move fast and break things. With a political storm brewing, was this the right time for the EU’s most important member state to embark on a&nbsp;period of prolonged introspection?</p> <p>Three tumultuous months later, with German democracy itself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/20/all-eyes-on-far-right-afd-in-german-election-rocked-by-violence-and-us-interference\">crosshairs</a> of a hostile Trump administration, Sunday’s poll feels more like a valuable opportunity for an emergency reset. Any federal election carries huge significance beyond Germany’s borders. This poll is distinguished by being the first of a new era – one in which the transatlantic alliance that underpinned Europe’s postwar security can no longer be relied upon. Its outcome will be fundamental to shaping the EU’s response to that new reality, as existential decisions are made over <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/european-fiscal-rules-would-need-reform-higher-defence-spending-german-minister-2025-02-17/\">defence spending</a> and protecting Ukraine.</p> <p>With the centre-right coalition of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union comfortably <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/\">ahead</a> in the polls, the strong likelihood is that Mr Scholz, a Social Democrat, will be replaced as chancellor by Friedrich Merz.

Increasingly hawkish on Russia and the need to protect the EU’s eastern flank, he would be likely to take a more expansive approach on the European stage than Mr&nbsp;Scholz, whose inward focus <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/paris-pins-hopes-for-franco-german-renaissance-on-merz/\">exasperated</a> the French president, Emmanuel Macron.</p> <p>Mr Scholz had his reasons for that. However alarming the international outlook, for many voters Germany’s urgent priorities remain narrowly domestic. A spate of fatal attacks involving migrant suspects has been ruthlessly exploited by the far‑right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, driving immigration to the top of the political agenda.</p> <p>All mainstream parties remain committed to the traditional <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/afd-firewall-germany-political-consensus-explained/a-71457050\">firewall</a> excluding the AfD from power (though Mr Merz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG-VkBJQtxY\">relied</a> on its votes to pass a recent opposition motion on stricter migration rules). But polls suggest it will achieve a comfortable second place on Sunday – a deeply disturbing position of strength for an ethno-nationalist party officially classified as suspected extremist. The party’s growing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy082dn7rkqo\">popularity</a> among under-35 voters, and particularly&nbsp;among young men, is ominous.</p> <p>The rise of the far right has been accelerated by prolonged economic <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/germany-europes-largest-economy-is-facing-a-third-consecutive-year-of-recession-13289549\">stagnation</a>. Post-pandemic, Germany’s business model has been crushed by an end to the era of cheap Russian energy, higher interest rates and falling demand for its exports. Since Covid, almost a quarter of a million <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdba0fc4-f651-41fa-9706-acaa4dc15bd0\">manufacturing jobs</a> have been lost, in a country that prided itself on being Europe’s industrial powerhouse. A historic reluctance to borrow to invest – constitutionally enshrined in the 2008 debt brake – has become a liability, stymieing Mr&nbsp;Scholz’s attempts to respond.</p> <p>A suddenly isolated Europe needs a confident and&nbsp;prospering Germany at its heart. In a fragmented political landscape, it will almost certainly fall to another broad coalition government, led by Mr&nbsp;Merz, to try to deliver this. The AfD will, meanwhile, position itself as a Trumpian alternative-in-waiting, talked up by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/20/musk-germany-election-afd-x-twitter/\">Elon Musk</a> and the US vice‑president, JD Vance. Rarely has it been so important that the politics of moderation and consensus should succeed. In the post‑reunification&nbsp;era, the stakes both inside and outside Germany have never felt higher.</p>\n",

      "Article: <p>The pain and damage wreaked in the last 16 months will reverberate through families, communities and the Middle East for decades to come. On Thursday, the bodies of two young children and their mother, and that of an 83-year-old peace activist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/20/israel-gaza-hamas-hands-over-hostages-bodies\">were returned</a> to Israel by Hamas. They were kidnapped in&nbsp;the 7&nbsp;October 2023 raid in which the militants killed&nbsp;around 1,200 Israelis and others. Around 48,000&nbsp;Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war&nbsp;in&nbsp;response.</p> <p>It was always feared that the ceasefire deal, which has brought desperately needed respite for Palestinians in Gaza and the return of Israeli and foreign hostages, would be fleeting. The six-week opening stage is due to expire on 1 March. The talks on the more complicated second stage have yet to begin, more than a fortnight after they were due.</p> <p>There are two glimmers of hope. The first was the striking confidence of Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/hamas-hostages-israel-gaza-ceasefire-agreement-second-phase\">declaring</a> last weekend that “phase two is absolutely going to begin”. The second is that Hamas, militarily battered and under pressure within Gaza and from Arab governments, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/hamas-hostages-israel-gaza-ceasefire-agreement-second-phase\">said</a> that in the next phase it would be willing to release all remaining hostages at once, rather than in staggered groups. In exchange, it wants Israel’s complete and rapid military withdrawal from Gaza and the release of hundreds more Palestinians held by Israel. Benjamin&nbsp;Netanyahu has <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-said-to-condition-deals-2nd-phase-on-end-of-hamas-presence-in-gaza-no-pa-rule/\">reportedly said</a> that this phase would be conditional on the disarming of Hamas and the end of its presence in Gaza.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister does not want to cross Mr Trump. But it has never been in his interests to reach phase two, not least because of the threat that the extremist coalition member Bezalel Smotrich may walk out. His security chiefs long believed politics was the biggest obstruction to a deal. Now he has <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-panned-after-senior-source-claims-security-chiefs-botched-hostage-talks/\">dismissed them</a> from the negotiation team, replacing them with his well-connected confidant <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/ron-dermer-netanyahu-trump-israel-gaza-ceasefire-talks/\">Ron Dermer</a>, who could yet attempt to bypass Mr&nbsp;Witkoff and deal with Mr Trump directly.</p> <p>At this late stage, the extension of phase one would be better than nothing. The agreement and implementation of phase two, inherently more difficult, would be a major step forward. But the immense question of phase three looms: what form&nbsp;reconstruction in Gaza might take. Mr&nbsp;Trump’s&nbsp;abhorrent announcement that Palestinians should make way for a US-owned “Riviera of the Middle East” – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/netanyahu-committed-to-trumps-plan-to-take-over-gaza\">embraced </a>by Mr&nbsp;Netanyahu – has precipitated a discussion that had been sidestepped lest it derail the deal, as well as due to its inherent complexity.</p> <p>Ethnically cleansing Palestinians would require countries willing to take them. Though Egypt and Jordan rely heavily on US aid, their leaders cannot afford to comply. Arab countries <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/arab-leaders-set-to-meet-to-counter-trumps-gaza-plan\">will meet in Riyadh</a> on Friday as they scramble for an alternative plan, discussing Cairo’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/egypt-gaza-reconstruction-plan-hamas\">hastily drawn-up</a> proposal under which the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and others would fund reconstruction, with Hamas formally excluded from governance and oversight of the work. Even if they can find a theoretically workable solution, Mr&nbsp;Trump would need to be flattered into agreement. In the meantime, with hostages still held, and with conditions in Gaza <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-265-gaza-strip-enarhe\">remaining so dire</a>, the priority must be to maintain the ceasefire. Whether or not it can be the foundation of a long-term response to this crisis, it is still essential to save lives now.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Title: The Guardian view on Scottish Labour: a defining moment for Anas Sarwar\n",
      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> After a spectacular general election win, Keir Starmer’s party is struggling to repeat its success in the approaching Holyrood contest\n",
      "Article: <p>​Only a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/05/snp-humiliation-scotland-independence-john-swinney\">Labour</a> won the most votes and a majority of seats in Scotland for the first time since 2010. A 16-point swing from the Scottish National party yielded a harvest of 37 Westminster Labour MPs. The SNP, which had changed leaders twice in little over a year, plummeted from 48&nbsp;Westminster MPs to a mere nine.</p> <p>Yet if anyone assumes Labour is now in the driving seat of Scottish electoral politics again, they have not been paying attention. <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/scotland/article/blame-game-erupts-as-labour-sees-chance-to-oust-snp-slip-away-h3gsx3vcm\">A poll last week</a> showed Labour facing its worst Holyrood election result since devolution began, with only 18% of Scots planning to vote for Anas Sarwar’s party when the Scottish parliament comes up for election in 2026. The SNP, meanwhile, is on course to be the largest party at Holyrood again, potentially enabling the current first minister, John Swinney, to form the nationalists’ fifth consecutive devolved administration.</p> <p>With more than a year to go before the Holyrood vote, much may obviously change. Nevertheless, the figures provide a sobering backdrop to this weekend’s <a href=\"https://scottishlabour.org.uk/conference2025/\">Scottish Labour conference</a> in Glasgow. This gathering, which Mr Sarwar addresses on Friday, followed by Sir&nbsp;Keir&nbsp;Starmer on Sunday, could have been a celebration of one victory and a launchpad for a second. Instead, the conference is likely to be a reality check for Labour on the turbulent Scottish and British political landscape after a quarter of a century of devolution.</p> <p>Part of Labour’s rapid decline in Scotland is undoubtedly explained by the Starmer government’s poor start last year. Cuts in winter fuel payments were an early blow. National insurance rises and Labour’s refusal to compensate the <a href=\"https://www.waspi.co.uk/\">Waspi women</a> campaigners or to change the two-child welfare cap did damage too. Yet these policies were unpopular in England and Wales as well as in Scotland.</p> <p>The difference is that all these issues were exploited by the SNP in ways that the main opposition party in England, the Conservatives, could not match. The upshot in Scotland is that Mr Swinney has been able to steady the SNP ship, steering his party away from arguments about identity and back towards economic and social justice issues. In England, meanwhile, Kemi&nbsp;Badenoch is getting almost nowhere.</p> <p>Yet the SNP’s recovery owes at least as much to Nigel Farage as to Mr Swinney. Reform UK is now on 14% in Holyrood polling, and has been able to attract support from Labour voters, older and working-class pro-union men in particular. That would give Reform UK around 15 Holyrood seats, despite having little campaign organisation in Scotland. The SNP is less vulnerable, since it can rely on pro-independence voters. As a result, even though SNP support is currently <a href=\"https://www.whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-be-likely-to-vote-in-a-uk-general-election-asked-since-2024-general-election/\">flatlining</a>, it has pulled away from the other parties, as Labour slips and Reform UK advances.</p> <p>The Starmer government has done important things for Scotland, ​<a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/uk-budget-has-improved-scottish-funding-outlook-tough-choices-loom-down-line\">especially on public sector pay</a>. And the SNP government’s record is flimsy on several fronts, including health and education. Nevertheless, Mr Sarwar remains caught between the fiscal caution of the Labour government in London and the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/scotland/2025/02/when-will-labour-tell-the-truth-about-scotland\">costly and often inefficient</a>, but still popular, universalism of SNP welfare and health programmes nearer to home. In his pre-conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/19/scottish-labour-2026-election-challenge-win-anas-sarwar\">interview</a> with this paper, Mr&nbsp;Sarwar said he recognised both the challenge and the importance of his speech to delegates on Friday. Scottish Labour has not yet articulated a distinct and convincing programme of its own. Yet that is what Mr&nbsp;Sarwar needs to do in Glasgow this weekend.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Title: The Guardian view on Labour and the constitution: respect judicial independence\n",
      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The rule of law is under threat around the world, making it all the more vital to defend it at home\n",
      "Article: <p>Separation of the judiciary from other branches of power is a recent innovation in Britain’s constitution. The supreme court was established in 2009 and a culture of respect for the independence of the courts is&nbsp;not deeply entrenched.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Lady Carr reminded Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch of that duty. The lady chief justice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/18/top-judge-deeply-troubled-by-pmqs-exchange-on-gaza-asylum-case\">rebuked</a> the prime minister and the Conservative leader for exchanges in the Commons last week regarding a court decision in the case of a family of refugees from Gaza. Earlier this year an immigration tribunal recognised the validity of their entitlement to settle in the UK under the European convention on human rights, overturning a previous refusal. Mrs Badenoch said this was the wrong decision&nbsp;and challenged Sir Keir to agree. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/12/judge-granted-palestinian-family-asylum-made-wrong-decision-keir-starmer\">He did</a>, adding that the decision should not stand and that the relevant “legal&nbsp;loophole” would be closed.</p> <p>Lady Carr described both the question and the answer as “unacceptable”. The objection, distinct from the humanitarian merit of the original asylum claim, is that a judge’s decision should not be denounced from the dispatch box. If ministers don’t like a ruling, they can appeal against it. That is how the constitution works.</p> <p>As a former barrister with a background in human rights, Sir Keir knows this well enough. Before entering&nbsp;Downing Street he was committed to preserving and reinforcing the line that Lady Carr has&nbsp;now been forced to bring back to his attention.</p> <p>Mrs Badenoch, by contrast, is continuing a trend of growing Tory contempt for judicial independence. Eurosceptic Conservatives were intensely irritated by a court ruling that upheld parliament’s role in Brexit – a tussle that culminated in the supreme court overturning Boris Johnson’s unlawful prorogation of the legislature in 2019. In subsequent years, Mr Johnson and his successors switched their ire to judicial decisions that obstructed plans to deport asylum claimants to Rwanda. That led to the constitutional absurdity of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/apr/22/rwanda-deportations-bill-passes-parliament-sunak\">parliamentary bill </a>declaring that the east African state must, by law, be&nbsp;considered safe.</p> <p>To Sir Keir’s credit, that statute is to be repealed. But last week’s Commons exchange is a worrying sign that the current Downing Street regime is experiencing some of the same frustrations as the last one, and vulnerable to the same political impulse – denouncing judges and decrying “loopholes” when courts uphold fundamental human rights regarding immigration.</p> <p>That isn’t the only contested area. Lord Hermer, the attorney general, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/13/attorney-general-richard-hermer-lightning-rod-for-criticism-of-starmer\">targeted for attack</a> by Conservative media for cases he defended as a barrister before being appointed by Sir Keir as the government’s most senior law officer. There is no evidence of wrongdoing, only insinuations of liberal bias and a tendentious allegation of conflicts of interest. That hostility is stoked by a whispering campaign from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/31/keir-starmer-has-full-confidence-in-attorney-general-amid-party-criticism\">within Labour ranks</a> suggesting that the attorney general’s pernickety attitude to lawfulness gets in the way of dynamic government.</p> <p>The impulse to subordinate law to executive will is debilitating to a democracy, as Donald Trump is demonstrating. The US president rails against constitutional safeguards that deny him untrammelled power. He has many cheerleaders on this side of the Atlantic, including a Conservative party that has already proved itself unsafe as a guarantor of judicial independence. All the more reason for Sir Keir and Labour to hold the line.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Article: <p>When settling wars rewards lawlessness, displaces populations and fuels lasting grievances, the result is more war. That was the former foreign secretary William&nbsp;Hague’s <a href=\"https://archive.ph/CiQ2V\">verdict</a> on Donald Trump’s approach to peacemaking, drawing lessons from the Balkans, the second world war and the Middle East. A more insecure world will require Britain to increase defence spending. The UK currently could not sustain major troop deployments in Ukraine, undermining the idea it&nbsp;could provide Kyiv with “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/16/starmer-ready-to-put-british-troops-on-the-ground-in-ukraine-if-peace-deal-reached\">security guarantees</a>”.</p> <p>This is a dilemma faced across Europe, leading the EU to see <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/eu-leaders-ask-eib-to-review-lending-rules-issue-defence-debt/\">deficit-financed defence spending</a> as the answer. In contrast, Britain remains seemingly bound by economic orthodoxy, prioritising fiscal discipline over borrowing. The UK Treasury has apparently asked unprotected public services – excluding health, education and defence – to prepare for <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/public-services-prepare-for-up-to-11-cuts-as-defence-secretary-says-we-must-rearm-13312077\">real-terms cuts of up to 11%</a> ahead of June’s spending review, as funds are diverted to the military. This would be a mistake.</p> <p>Britain’s austerity is at odds with the majority of EU states that seem ready to apply pandemic lessons to strengthen defence, counter Russian threats and reduce reliance on the US. At the <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-proposes-triggering-clause-to-massively-boost-defense-spending/\">Munich Security Conference</a>, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, signalled a major fiscal shift, invoking an “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/19/why-europes-defence-spending-may-need-a-bold-new-approach\">escape clause</a>” to exclude <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-eyes-tweak-fiscal-rules-allow-more-defence-spending-2025-02-07/\">military</a> spending from EU deficit rules – mirroring the Covid response, when the EU suspended fiscal constraints to enable stimulus spending.</p> <p>This is a <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake\">pragmatic</a> shift, acknowledging that the menace of a revanchist Moscow outweighs self‑imposed budget limits. Sir Keir Starmer should take note. If the Treasury funds defence by cutting existing budgets, departments like justice, local government and welfare will suffer real-terms reductions to their outlays. This would be politically unsustainable. Neoclassical economists may argue that Britain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is too high, but it remains <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-22102024-bp\">comparable</a> to those of France, Italy and Spain. Defence spending arguably also has a high fiscal multiplier, generating more economic activity and job creation than other expenditures.</p> <p>Mr Trump demands Nato members spend <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-defends-demand-nato-members-071437856.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAExDNTLRvcKywnLzWtUxN-4KiasdeUvsaA2FwYNgrt8eCSOOHWFQo5R5Kzx9ImUSX8QERCVc8135RtRFYrb6ybEcGlcEINChRTxm7j-9q_FY4UaJryVjbaUbCFZ_el92OeazFXMeOljA9sEXMssP0vjwclHk71TVD7K7HmqJat-w\">5% of GDP</a> on defence. This has forced a historic <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/eu-joint-defence-debt-has-many-hoops-go-through-2025-02-18/\">shift</a> in EU policy, potentially setting a precedent for future deficit exemptions in green investment and industrial policy. Europe should also heed Mario Draghi’s advice: in crises, fiscal policy must drive growth and recovery. In <a href=\"https://cepr.org/system/files/publication-files/224792-policy_insight_137_europe_back_to_domestic_growth.pdf\">December</a>, the former head of the European Central Bank contrasted Europe’s austerity with US stimulus, noting that after the financial crash, the US injected €7.8tn into its economy through deficit spending, while the eurozone managed €560bn. Europe’s restrictive fiscal policy stifled growth, while the US used it far more effectively.</p> <p>In this volatile world, the EU and Britain must address Covid-era debt. Ongoing <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-debt-bomb-budget-negotiations-brussels-belgium-27-commissioners-mff-veto/\">negotiations</a> over EU pandemic borrowing suggest more austerity ahead – misguided, since this spending wasn’t reckless but a necessary crisis response. The ECB should <a href=\"https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=62355\">absorb</a> EU pandemic debt to prevent further&nbsp;austerity and boost recovery. In Britain, the&nbsp;Bank of England should stop selling Covid debt, as it’s raising yields and tightening fiscal conditions&nbsp;unnecessarily.</p> <p>“There are decades when nothing happens; and there are weeks when decades happen,” Lenin is often quoted as saying. The past seven days have underscored just how quickly history moves – and how swiftly governments must adapt. Europe has already begun that shift.

He suggested he could use Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.eurasiagroup.net/live-post/dont-squeeze-taiwan\">as leverage with China</a> on issues including trade. John Bolton, who became his national security adviser, later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/john-bolton-book-trump-china-dictators-saudi-arabia\">said</a> (though Mr Trump denied it) that the president pleaded with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to ensure he would win the next election, “stress[ing] the importance of … increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome”.</p> <p>Mr Trump’s Middle East policy is not only pleasing to his evangelical Christian supporters. His repugnant proposal to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza, allowing the construction of an American-owned “Riviera”, is shocking but in many ways builds upon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/waterfront-property-what-are-trumps-real-estate-interests-in-palestine\">ideas long held by</a> businessman friends as well as Israeli settlers. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a former real-estate developer charged with overseeing Middle East policy in Mr Trump’s first term, suggested last year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/19/jared-kushner-gaza-waterfront-property-israel-negev\">Gaza’s “waterfront property”</a> could be “very valuable”. (Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, incidentally, became <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html\">a major investor in Mr Kushner’s private equity firm</a> after he left the&nbsp;administration.)</p> <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy tried to capitalise on Mr&nbsp;Trump’s economic transactionalism by offering access to Ukraine’s resources, notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/what-are-ukraines-critical-minerals-and-why-does-trump-want-them\">minerals</a>, in exchange for security. He got Mr Trump’s attention – but the terms of the resulting US <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/17/revealed-trump-confidential-plan-ukraine-stranglehold/\">demand</a> make it look less like diplomacy than extortion. The US president prices up everything and knows the value of nothing. Others must now endeavour to show him that his plans will not come as cheaply as he believes.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> A performative ‘tough on crime’ approach by politicians has been both ineffective and ruinously expensive\n",
      "Article: <p>It was as shadow home secretary in the early 1990s that Tony Blair came up with “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime” – a characteristically New Labour <a href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191866692.001.0001/q-oro-ed6-00001715\">formulation</a> intended to finesse a perceived vulnerability on law and order issues. Yet in subsequent decades, governments of all stripes have focused overwhelmingly on the first clause, and&nbsp;treated the second as an optional extra.</p> <p>The disastrous result is a criminal justice system on the brink of collapse, as the former Conservative justice&nbsp;secretary, David Gauke, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/feb/18/prison-system-crisis-due-to-overreliance-on-long-sentences-says-gauke-review\">outlined</a> in his interim report on the sentencing system in England and Wales. Cumulative Westminster pressure for longer prison terms has led to a doubling of the incarcerated population in 30 years. More draconian sentencing and greater recall of released offenders who break parole have left the prison estate bursting at the seams and necessitated ad hoc early release schemes. Labour’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-new-prison-places-to-be-built-to-keep-streets-safe\">plans</a> to deliver 14,000 extra prison places by 2031 – at a cost of £10bn – will not be enough to keep pace with rising numbers.</p> <p>Systemic overreliance on custodial punishment is not only ruinously expensive and unsustainable. It is also, as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-sentencing-review-history-and-trends-in-sentencing\">report</a> makes clear, dysfunctional and counterproductive. Our scandalously overcrowded prisons are dangerous and despairing places, which struggle to adequately recruit and retain overstretched prison officers. Resources to facilitate rehabilitative work for inmates are shamefully threadbare, and the cost of banging so many people up has diverted money from services dedicated to reducing the possibility of their reoffending. A vicious cycle of recidivism is the dismal and inevitable outcome.</p> <p>A proper national debate on a broken system is needed. This government-commissioned review will hopefully be the catalyst for one. Final recommendations will be made in the spring, but it is already clear that they will call for a renewed focus on prevention alongside punishment, and a more liberal approach to sentencing. As Mr Gauke rightly points out: “Punishment will always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, but it is not the only aim; and prison is not the only form of punishment.”</p> <p>A far less kneejerk approach to custodial sentencing, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgx01wyprzo\">relation</a> to more minor offences, would ease the intolerable pressure on the prison estate. It would also free up much-needed resources to invest in probation, rehabilitation, psychiatric services and addiction counselling. The&nbsp;public would be better protected as a result.</p> <p>After 30 years of performative “tough on crime” politics, making and winning this argument will not be easy. From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jun/20/ken-clarke-abandon-sentence-cuts\">Ken Clarke</a> to Rory Stewart and Mr&nbsp;Gauke himself, successive Conservative ministers attempted in the 2010s to address the damaging explosion in the prison population. All fell foul of a hostile rightwing media, and their governments’ unwillingness to abandon a simplistically conceived “law and order” agenda.</p> <p>As they contend with the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, Sir Keir Starmer and his justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, will also face considerable political headwinds. But the case for reform is overwhelming. Sir Keir’s prisons minister,&nbsp;James Timpson – a former chair of the Prison Reform Trust – is a vocal advocate of lowering the rate of incarceration and improving conditions. When Mr Gauke’s final report is published later this year, Labour should have the&nbsp;courage of its convictions and act on it.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Article: <p>Donald Trump’s return to the White House is so far proving more nightmarish for US allies and friends than adversaries. China certainly doesn’t relish a trade war with the US, but it was better prepared than others for Mr Trump’s <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/10/business/china-us-trade-tariffs-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html\">tariffs</a>, and both sides appear to be leaving room for a potential deal. And, though China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is poised for worse to come, the second Trump term is bringing Beijing opportunities as&nbsp;well as problems.</p> <p>International respect for the US <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/making-america-great-global-perceptions-china-russia-and-united-states-international\">plummeted</a> under his last administration. As the US president turns the screws on long-term partners, China is looking to take advantage. Colombia quickly caved to Mr&nbsp;Trump on the matter of migrant returns, but China’s ambassador&nbsp;has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-china-south-america-foreign-policy\">celebrating</a> the “best moment” in&nbsp;relations between Bogotá and Beijing. Under pressure from the Trump administration, Panama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/04/marco-rubio-panama-china-us-relationship-infrastructure-plan\">announced</a> that it would allow its participation in China’s global infrastructure plan, the belt and road initiative (BRI), to expire. Yet behind-the-scenes arm-twisting had already begun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/us-panama-relationship-trump\">tilting Panama back</a> towards the US. Mr&nbsp;Trump’s attempts to humiliate and bully may backfire there and across the region.</p> <p>He is likely to find it harder going, too, away from his back yard, in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The US has never been afraid to use hard power, but trade, aid and military alliances have also been key to its hegemony. No longer. Mr Trump’s attack on South Africa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/trump-cuts-aid-to-south-africa-over-racial-discrimination-against-afrikaners\">cutting financial assistance</a>, may delight Elon&nbsp;Musk, but pointlessly alienates an important middle power. His declaration that the US will expand its territory in various locations – using military force if necessary – shows his utter contempt for the law, as does his order to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-order-foreign-bribery-act\">halt enforcement</a> of US legislation banning the bribery of foreign officials.</p> <p>China might well benefit by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/07/donald-trump-usaid-shutdown-impact-china-relationship-funding\">addressing some of the impact</a> of the US axing aid – it funds at least one affected group. But it has focused more on loans and infrastructure than partnership with local organisations, and its record suggests it is unlikely to fill the financial holes left by the US.</p> <p>There is little naivety about engagement with Beijing these days, but many countries will conclude that they have little choice but to hedge their bets. China is most likely to gain ground in multilateral institutions, and among middle‑income nations that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/09/more-people-view-the-us-positively-than-china-across-35-surveyed-countries/\">view it much more positively</a> than high-income ones.</p> <p>Mr Vance’s blast at European leaders at the Munich security conference, and promotion of the hard right, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/15/jd-vance-munich-speech-laid-bare-collapse-transatlantic-alliance-us-europe\">shocking moment of clarity</a>. Yet far from holding out a velvet-gloved hand, Beijing has just appointed a controversial “wolf warrior” diplomat as its special representative for European affairs. Lu Shaye <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b608fa8-1af7-41a2-bd71-31c2eda33dbf\">sparked fury</a> when, as ambassador to France, he questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet states and Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea. As China and the US contend, others are likely to find themselves not wooed but pressured by both sides.</p> <p>China rose more rapidly in the global order than it could have expected. Now it is watching US power deteriorate far more quickly. That’s promising for a country that wants a multipolar world without inconvenient universal values. Yet the question is not just how others react to Beijing’s growing power but whether a security free-rider may find itself taking on roles it hoped to avoid, or having to cope with the vacuum left if it doesn’t.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The increased visibility of people whose lives have been shaped by social services is a change for the better\n",
      "Article: <p>Select committee hearings typically involve experts answering questions from MPs. Last week there was a&nbsp;strikingly different <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/event/23321/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/\">session</a>, as four care-experienced young people offered their perspectives to the education committee. The point was to increase MPs’ insight by confronting them with children for whom social care is a hugely important fact of life.</p> <p>Some of the material shared was personal. But these witnesses also had opinions about how services could be changed to better meet the needs of young people in similar positions. As well as describing losses and disappointments, they spoke warmly about adults who&nbsp;had supported them. This included teachers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/may/11/what-does-the-children-and-social-work-act-mean-for-frontline-staff\">personal advisers</a> (support workers for care leavers up&nbsp;to age 25) and foster carers. One young woman said&nbsp;her independent visitor (a voluntary role) was a&nbsp;key person&nbsp;in her life.</p> <p>The importance of sustained relationships was a theme that shone through. Each young person described painful feelings of disconnection. These can be personal but also institutional – for example, the gap between children’s and adult mental health services, or the lack of accommodation outside term time for students who have no other home. The need to support siblings to keep in touch was raised, along with increased entitlements for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/01/the-guardian-view-on-kinship-carers-grandparents-cant-repair-a-broken-care-system\">kinship carers</a>.</p> <p>A clearer role for kinship care is one element in the children’s bill currently making its way through parliament, although advocates are disappointed that new allowances are not included. Concern about rising costs is the reason, with social care budgets widely recognised to be among the biggest challenges facing local government. The system as a whole is under huge strain. In 2022-23, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/18/overhaul-of-childrens-social-care-in-england-will-crack-down-on-firms-profiteering\">councils in England spent £7bn</a> on looked-after children. At the end of March, there were <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/children-looked-after-in-england-including-adoptions\">83,630 children</a> in the care of local authorities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/18/more-than-one-in-three-uk-children-poverty-deprivation-record-high\">Poverty</a>, driven by austerity, is a key reason for this rising tide of need. While the change of government has brought new policies, including an attempt to limit the profits of private children’s homes and strengthen local authority commissioners, the reforms can also be viewed as the next stage in a process started by the last government. Josh&nbsp;MacAlister, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-childrens-social-care-a-heartbreaking-market\">led a review</a> commissioned by&nbsp;the Conservatives, is now a minister.</p> <p>Public awareness of the vulnerability of children separated from their parents dates back centuries –&nbsp;think of novels such as Oliver Twist. Research showing that a childhood in care is correlated with adverse life experiences including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4dyy9kgrro\">homelessness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/21/care-experienced-children-eight-times-more-likely-enter-youth-justice-system-england\">time in prison</a> is not new. But the increased visibility of care-experienced activists and advocates means that outdated ideas are being updated, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/19/lemn-sissay-brilliant-plans-improve-child-social-care-ignored-ministers\">renewed struggle</a> for improved rights and services takes shape. In Wales, new placements in children’s homes or other settings run for profit are <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2025/02/10/bill-to-remove-profit-from-childrens-care-in-wales-approved-by-senedd/\">being banned</a>.</p> <p>A campaign to make care experience a protected characteristic, in an amendment to the UK-wide Equality Act, would grant care-experienced people explicit protection from discrimination. The entitlements of 16- and 17-year-olds – including the right to be placed in care, as opposed to regulated accommodation – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-the-care-leaving-age-teenagers-are-children-too\">are in urgent need of being strengthened. </a>While there are, of course, a range of views about priorities, it is right that the voices of care-experienced people are being heard. As Jake Hartley, who grew up in a foster home in Lancashire, told MPs last week, “One person can make a world of difference.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial: </strong>The vice-president’s speech on Friday was another wake-up call for European leaders. On defence and in other areas, they need to chart their own course\n",
      "Article: <p>In 2007, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/18/putin-speech-wake-up-call-post-cold-war-order-liberal-2007-00009918\">delivered</a> a speech to the Munich security conference that stunned western diplomats by launching an unforeseen assault on the post-1989 international order. The United States, alleged Mr Putin, had perniciously manufactured a unipolar world “in which there is one master, one sovereign”. Seven years later, Russian forces illegally <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-crisis-in-Crimea-and-eastern-Ukraine\">occupied</a> Crimea, and Moscow-funded separatists seized swathes of territory in eastern Ukraine, in what turned out to be the precursor to full-blown invasion.</p> <p>Nearly two decades later, the disturbing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-stuns-munich-conference-with-blistering-attack-on-europes-leaders\">speech</a> at the same venue by the US vice-president, JD Vance, may prove to be similarly significant as the geopolitics of the 21st century continue to shift. Mr&nbsp;Vance had been expected to concentrate last Friday’s remarks on Ukraine, after a week in which Donald Trump appeared to be unilaterally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/13/the-guardian-view-on-trump-and-putin-ukraines-future-must-not-be-decided-without-it\">preparing</a> to negotiate a ceasefire deal entirely on Mr Putin’s terms. Instead, he used his platform as a pulpit from which to berate the US’s European allies on issues such as multiculturalism, migration and the regulation of social media. Indefensibly, the Trump administration now actively cheerleads for far-right parties such as Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, whose leader, Alice&nbsp;Weidel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-alice-weidel-meeting-germany-far-right\">he chose to meet</a> in Munich.</p> <p>A month into Trump 2.0, Mr Vance and other senior outriders such as Elon Musk are full of ideological hubris and jubilant self-regard. But the vice-president’s use of Maga-style culture war rhetoric to attack European governments amounted to more than mere trolling. In deeply ominous fashion it also shredded the idea of a “west” that shares fundamental values.</p> <p>In the post-cold war era, the transatlantic alliance was founded on a common commitment to international norms that this White House holds in sneering contempt. Mr Trump’s brutally transactional approach is infused with a Hobbesian cynicism – witness his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b08b7258-7ae0-4bae-9499-e6d3183d5894\">determination</a> to exploit Ukraine’s vulnerability to seize 50% of its rare earth minerals on favourable terms. Europe must swiftly learn to adapt to an isolationist US that sees it as an ideological adversary and economic competitor.</p> <p>Conflicts and challenging trade-offs are inevitable. Mr Vance’s <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/jd-vance-what-i-worry-about-is-the-threat-from-within/\">excoriation</a> of “digital censorship” in Europe is a prelude to future attempts to see off the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vance-warns-eu-ai-overregulation-paris/\">regulation</a> of US tech companies via the EU Digital Services Act. On security and defence, climate action and the terms of transatlantic trade, European nations will need to find the unity to stand up to “America-first” bullying tactics, and begin to lay foundations for greater strategic and economic autonomy.</p> <p>This week’s crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/15/europe-will-not-take-part-in-us-russia-talks-ukraine-kellogg\">meeting</a> on Ukraine in Paris, convened at short notice by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is a step in the right direction. Amid justified fears of a neo-imperial carve-up, it is imperative to ensure that Europe, along with Ukraine itself, plays a full part in any future negotiations with Mr Putin – all the more so given that the apparent US expectation that it would police the result.</p> <p>Europe was slow to wake up to the implications of a newly rivalrous and multipolar world, in which transatlantic ties would no longer bind in the same way. The new reality will be characterised by Trumpian bluff, bluster and brinkmanship. Following Mr Vance’s visit to Munich, leaders can hardly say they have not been warned. The task now&nbsp;is to find ways to safeguard the European model from an increasingly sinister US administration that would love to see it fail.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Angela Rayner, the housing minister, is fighting to make new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/17/budget-2024-angela-rayner-rachel-reeves-social-housebuilding\">funding for affordable homes</a> a priority in the spending review.</p> <p>But house prices are now out of the reach of millions of people without family wealth to draw on, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/19/end-of-landlords-surprisingly-simple-solution-to-uk-housing-crisis\">one in 21 adults is a landlord</a>. Building a way out of such baked-in inequalities – as ministers have pledged to do – is enormously challenging. The danger is not only that Labour finds itself unable to meet ambitious pledges in terms of numbers, or because objections lead to schemes becoming bogged down in planning and local politics. Already, it is clear that some “new&nbsp;towns” will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/12/up-to-12-new-towns-will-be-under-construction-in-england-by-next-election-says-starmer\">extensions to existing towns and cities</a> – more like new suburbs.</p> <p>The bigger problem is that the interests of the big building companies that the government relies on to deliver its policy are not the same as those of people who need homes. To maximise their profits, and value to shareholders, housebuilders want prices as high as possible, even if this places them out of reach for first-time buyers, or those without hefty deposits. Last month, the Competition and Markets Authority <a href=\"https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/government/cma-extends-probe-into-seven-housebuilders-13-01-2025/\">extended its investigation</a> into seven firms that it said “may have exchanged competitively sensitive information”.</p> <p>Increasing the supply of affordable homes for social rent, meanwhile, has not been seen as a priority, with even housing associations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/20/london-affordable-homes-housebuilding-crisis\">cutting back</a> partly due to raised maintenance costs and tighter regulations since the Grenfell Tower fire. Fifteen years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/biggest-shakeup-in-social-housing\">George Osborne cut funding</a> for affordable housing by 60%, the impact of this hollowing out of the state’s role as a housing provider is clearer than ever. The poorest households and those who are homeless bear the brunt, while wealthy people have been incentivised&nbsp;to own multiple properties and earn income from rent.</p> <p>Housing is not the only area of life in which many young people face more restricted opportunities than their parents. But shelter is such a basic human need that its importance is hard to overestimate. Ministers must use every lever at their disposal to ensure that new homes are built on terms as favourable as possible to the people who will live in them – not according to rules made by developers.</p>\n",

      "Subheading: Principled, charismatic and humorous, the murdered Russian opposition leader was everything Vladimir Putin is not\n",
      "Article: <p>It is exactly one year since Alexei Navalny, Russia’s best-known opposition leader and anti-corruption activist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/russian-activist-and-putin-critic-alexei-navalny-dies-in-prison\">was murdered</a> in an Arctic penal colony by Vladimir Putin’s regime. Countless other political opponents, critics and dissidents have been killed, jailed or exiled since Putin first became president 25 years ago.</p> <p>All vestiges of an open society, democratic accountability, independent media and free speech in Russia have been eviscerated in that time. Accused of war crimes in Ukraine, which he invaded three years ago this month, Putin poses an undeniable threat to Europe and Britain – as well as to his own people. Yet this is the man with whom Donald Trump now wants to be friends.</p> <p>Navalny’s fate was terrible, and instructive. No radical, he tried to reform Russia from within. His Anti-Corruption Foundation published factual investigations into official wrongdoing. He ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013. But increased prominence brought increased persecution, and he was barred from the 2018 presidential election. More than anything, perhaps, he was a patriot, principled, charismatic, popular and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/03/alexei-navalny-patriot-russia-books\">humorous</a> – everything Putin is not. In 2020 Navalny almost died, poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent. In 2021, he was rearrested, jailed, removed to the Polar Wolf Arctic camp, isolated, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_ToUrs7lg\">silenced and killed</a>.</p> <p>The illegitimate victor of numerous gerrymandered elections, Putin felt so threatened by Navalny during the latter’s lifetime that he would not say his name in public. With its habitual lies, the Kremlin denied any responsibility for his death. The official cause, typically cruel and mocking, was given as “sudden death syndrome”. Navalny was 47. And yet Putin did not feel any more secure. New crackdowns on opposition figures followed, at home and abroad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Does Donald Trump have any idea how he is manipulated by this cynical ex-KGB thug? </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yulia Navalnaya has taken up her husband’s cause, bravely leading protest campaigns in exile. Last July, she was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg3mjzyp40go\">charged with “extremism”</a>, a potential death penalty offence. In March last year,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68854314\"> Leonid Volkov</a>, Navalny’s former chief of staff, was badly beaten in Vilnius, Lithuania.</p> <p>At home, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/europe-and-central-asia/eastern-europe-and-central-asia/russia/\">Amnesty International reports</a>, government critics routinely face “arbitrary prosecution, lengthy prison terms, violent attacks committed with impunity, and other reprisals”. An anti-war activist, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/11/russia-anti-war-activist-aleksei-gorinov-sentenced-to-three-additional-years-behind-bars/\">Aleksei Gorinov</a>, received an additional three-year jail sentence in November. A journalist, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur46/8365/2024/en/\">Natalya Filonova</a>, who opposes conscription, has suffered ever harsher jail conditions since 2022. Amnesty is demanding their release. Yet they are two among many detained for exercising their human rights.</p> <p>Putin’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/the-mysterious-violent-and-unsolved-deaths-of-putins-foes-and-critics-alexi-navalny\">killing sprees</a> date back at least to his genocidal campaign against Chechen separatists in the early 2000s. They include the murders of the ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, the investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya and the opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. Out-of-favour Russian oligarchs and businessmen frequently expire in mysterious circumstances. Soon after the Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin challenged his boss, he died in an unexplained plane crash. Yet Putin’s biggest homicidal exploits are geopolitical: his 2008 invasion of Georgia, 2014 annexation of Crimea, 2015 intervention in Syria – and Ukraine, again, in 2022. Many tens of thousands have died.</p> <p>When Trump calls Putin a “genius” who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire\">exhibits great “common sense”</a>, does he understand – does he care – that he is dealing with a ruthless killer? When, shattering the western consensus that Putin is an aggressor to be repulsed at all costs, Trump proposes a chummy tete-a-tete on Ukraine, does he have any idea how he is manipulated by this cynical ex-KGB thug? Does JD Vance, Trump’s ignorant vice-president, realise what a dangerous game he plays when he flirts with Europe’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-alice-weidel-meeting-germany-far-right\">pro-Putin neofascist far right</a>?

      "Title: The Observer view: Change to UK citizenship rule is cruel and misjudged\n",
      "Subheading: The government’s attempt to court Reform voters by penalising asylum seekers who arrive by the wrong route could backfire\n",
      "Article: <p>Last Monday, the government quietly added a few short lines to <a href=\"https://freemovement.org.uk/good-character-guidance-amended-to-block-refugees-from-naturalisation/\">Home Office guidance</a> that amount to a huge change in refugee policy. By amending the “good character” guidance for immigration staff processing asylum applications, ministers have effectively removed the right of refugees to apply for British citizenship if they arrived in the UK illegally or via a dangerous route, such as in a small boat or stowed away in a lorry.</p> <p>This cruel change means that refugees fleeing conflict, torture and human rights abuses, and who have long been granted protection and the right to live and work in the UK, will no longer be able to become British citizens. There is no justification for it. Although the government has said that the home secretary retains the discretion to grant citizenship <a href=\"https://freemovement.org.uk/good-character-guidance-amended-to-block-refugees-from-naturalisation/\">on an exceptional basis</a>, that is likely to be highly unusual. While immigration caseworkers have the discretion to disregard illegal entry for refugees who arrived in the UK as children, there is far from any guarantee that this will happen, and, given the high citizenship application fee, this measure will ensure that even child refugees are penalised as adults for their method of arrival. The immigration lawyer Colin Yeo has said these changes amount to a <a href=\"https://wewantedworkers.substack.com/p/new-change-to-home-office-policy?triedRedirect=true]\">contravention of the 1951 Refugee Convention</a>, to which Britain was a founding signatory.</p> <p>It is a worrying signal that there is more continuity between the punitive refugee policy of the Labour government and its Conservative predecessor than might have first appeared. One of Keir Starmer’s earliest actions in government was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/17/observer-view-on-labours-plans-to-scrap-our-cruel-unworkable-asylum-policy\">scrap Conservative policies</a> that detained anyone arriving in the UK through irregular means and prevented them from applying for asylum, with the intention that a small fraction would be deported to Rwanda, where their claims for asylum would have been heard and potentially granted by the Rwandan government. This effectively restored the rights of refugees to apply for asylum regardless of their means of arrival, in line with international law.</p> <p>This latest policy – not even debated by MPs prior to its introduction – is a step in the opposite direction, presumably designed to make the government look tough on refugees through undermining Britain’s international obligations. The government undoubtedly hopes that removing the right to ultimately seek citizenship in this way may deter desperate people from attempting the dangerous Channel crossing. But in recent years the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y45dmg2pjo\">number of deaths in the Channel </a>has risen even as ministers have tried to make Britain a more hostile place for asylum seekers.</p> <p>The truth is that, in a world where conflict and abject poverty act as strong push factors to increase the irregular movement of people across borders, the number of people making the Channel crossing is largely out of the government’s control. To the extent that it can influence these flows, enforcement to crack down on the human traffickers charging individuals thousands of pounds for dangerous journeys needs to be accompanied by the establishment of safe and legal routes that enable those who are in mortal peril to apply for asylum in the UK and other safe countries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A plurality of the public supports all refugees being able to apply for citizenship regardless of how they arrived in the UK</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For example, the Biden administration’s combination of restrictions on entry into the United States along its border with Mexico, together with the introduction of a sponsorship process for South American refugees to legally enter the US, were followed by a significant <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Deaths-in-the-Channel-Refugee-Council-report-January-2025.pdf\">drop in the number of irregular arrivals</a> in 2024.</p> <p>The government should also look to build public confidence in an asylum system beset by delays, by redoubling its efforts to process asylum applications quickly and efficiently, deporting those whose applications have been rejected and who do not have a right to stay in the UK.</p> <p>This intervention to prevent refugees from fully integrating into British society appears to be a wrong-headed political strategy to try to undermine Reform UK’s buoyancy in the polls. But there are serious political risks. A <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/fewer-than-1-in-10-people-support-badenochs-proposed-15-year-wait-on-citizenship-poll/\">plurality of the public</a> supports all refugees being able to apply for citizenship regardless of how they arrived in the UK; for those who voted Labour last year, it is 62%. In trying to appeal to Reform voters, there is a danger that Labour repels voters who might next time decide to vote Lib Dem or Green.</p> <p>In misleading the public by suggesting that reducing the number of people arriving on small boats to claim asylum is within the gift of politicians, Starmer risks building further support for Reform in the medium term if he cannot deliver on his pledge to “smash the gangs” and bring down the number of small boat crossings. He would do better to have an honest conversation with the public about the fact that we live in an unstable world where the irregular movement of people is likely to increase, and that reducing this requires a long-term strategy involving not just deterrence but strategies to reduce conflict, poverty and&nbsp;climate change, alongside the provision of more safe and legal routes to the west. This would undoubtedly take bravery and leadership. Ultimately, however, it is both the morally correct and the politically wise thing to do.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Article: <p>It is easy to become so used to scientific and social advances that we take them for granted. But sometimes we should pause to celebrate – to feel genuine awe – at the wonders that we have seen. Amid&nbsp;all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the&nbsp;last half century, we have witnessed nothing short&nbsp;of a miracle.</p> <p>Vaccination, in addition to clean water, sanitation and improved nutrition, has been one of the greatest contributors to global health. It is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59% between 1990 and 2022. It has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years\">since </a>the Expanded Programme on Immunisation was launched by the World Health Organization in 1974. Initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. Then, in 2000, came the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (<a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\">Gavi</a>), a public-private organisation&nbsp;that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs.</p> <p>The results have been remarkable. Prevention is better – and cheaper and easier – than cure. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. Almost all the world<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination\"> is now polio-free</a>. Cases of many other diseases have been slashed. Much more can be done: an estimated 5&nbsp;million children have been <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/one-year-anniversary-malaria-vaccine-rollout-underscores-remarkable-progress-offers\">protected against malaria </a>since routine vaccinations were launched a year ago. And from a scientific perspective, we are entering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/07/covid-vaccines-golden-era-pandemic-techology-diseases\">a&nbsp;golden age of vaccines</a>.</p> <p>Yet this is a dangerous moment in other ways. The climate crisis is spurring disease outbreaks. Conflict has dramatically increased <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/15/war-conflict-immunisation-vaccination-vaccine-hesitancy-nutrition-disease-children-who-unicef-measles-hpv\">the number of unprotected children</a>. Vaccine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/22/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-and-vaccine-scepticism-time-to-act\">scepticism</a> has grown. Now cuts to funding threaten to turn the clock back. The trashing of USAid will hinder delivery and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/02/trump-aid-spending-freeze-halts-leading-mvdp-malaria-vaccine-programme\">halted a groundbreaking programme</a> to create new malaria vaccines. Robert F Kennedy Jr – who once claimed that “no vaccine is safe and effective” and who tried to persuade the US government to rescind authorisation for the coronavirus vaccine at the height of the pandemic –&nbsp;was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/rfk-health-secretary-confirmed\">confirmed</a> this week as health secretary.</p> <p>Now the UK, one of Gavi’s founding donors and the country which has given most to its core programme, is considering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/10/dismay-as-uk-poised-to-cut-funding-for-global-vaccination-group-gavi\">a significant cut to its support</a>. This would be a grave error. While some aspects of Gavi’s approach have faced sensible scrutiny in the past, it has vaccinated over 1&nbsp;billion children and done so cost-effectively: 97&nbsp;pence in every pound it is given goes on vaccine programmes. Its success is also evident in the number of countries which have graduated from being beneficiaries to paying their own way; some, including Indonesia, are becoming donors in turn. And Gavi’s stockpiles help to keep people safe in wealthier countries too, as well as ensuring that poorer nations are healthier and more stable.</p> <p>For all these reasons, Gavi has long enjoyed bipartisan support in the UK, which has given it more than £2bn over the last four years. Now, more than ever, its funding must be sustained. The world is full of apparently intractable conflicts and complex moral dilemmas. Few decisions are truly simple for&nbsp;governments. But this one is a no-brainer. It should astonish us that we can so easily save lives.

      "Article: <p>Ukraine and its European allies braced for the worst when Donald Trump won a second term. But the scale of his surrender to Russian aggression has still shocked them. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin’s nearly three years of isolation by the west was broken by his 90-minute, “highly productive” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire\">conversation</a> with Mr&nbsp;Trump. Joe Biden called the Russian president a murderous dictator; Mr Trump praised Mr Putin’s mounting aggression towards Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/trump-putin-genius-russia-ukraine-crisis\">as “genius”</a>, days before the full-scale invasion of 2022. Now, two great powers plan negotiations – without regard for Ukraine, Europe or even Mr Trump’s own Ukraine envoy.</p> <p>Forget territorial integrity. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, described a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth\">“unrealistic”</a> and “an illusory goal”. Forget Ukrainian membership of Nato: “I don’t think it’s practical … I’m OK with that,” Mr Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/feb/12/i-dont-think-its-practical-trump-on-nato-membership-for-ukraine-video\">declared.</a> Forget US support: it will be up to European countries and others to provide any deterrent force, the US defence secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth\">made clear</a>. European security is no longer the primary focus for the US, added Mr Hegseth – and that was the toned-down version.</p> <p>Mr Trump had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/ukraine-may-be-russian-someday-trump-says-ahead-of-zelenskyy-meeting-with-vance\">aired the notion</a> that Ukraine “may be Russian some day”. Now he is not even feigning interest in Kyiv’s views. Mr Trump presumably believes that when the US turns off the tap, Ukraine and Europe will be forced to acquiesce in whatever he and Mr&nbsp;Putin have cooked up. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america\">told the Guardian</a> this week that “security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees”. Mr Trump has not only sidelined Mr&nbsp;Zelenskyy but further undermined him by pushing Russia’s narrative that <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-freak-out-us-russia-push-election/\">elections must be on the way</a>.</p> <p>Whatever Ukraine says in public, it understood that Nato membership was never imminent and surely anticipated some territorial concessions, however bitter after so much sacrifice. But Mr&nbsp;Trump has given way to Russian demands before even reaching the negotiating table. This sounds more like the art of surrender than the art of the deal. Mr Putin, however, is in no rush. The last thing he wants is Nato members’ forces on the ground in Ukraine. Dragging out talks might allow funding for Kyiv to dry up and domestic grumbling in Ukraine to morph into political instability, while Russia makes further battlefield advances.</p> <p>The failure of Mr Trump’s talks with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un showed how his rhetoric can run up against reality. Some have suggested that his self-regard will prevent him from settling for a deal in which Russia too obviously prevails. Perhaps he may yet latch on to a different exit if someone can find one that appeals to his vanity. Yet whatever the outcome, Mr Trump will surely declare it a triumph.</p> <p>For Ukraine, and others in the region, this is an existential war. For others – including the US – this has been about containing and degrading a hostile power, notwithstanding the sincere sympathy and grand statements about defending democracy. It is not only Ukraine that now hears the bell tolling. Despite fears that European domestic politics are tending away from staunch support for Kyiv, Thursday’s forceful responses to the US from European nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-ukraine-russia-war-meeting-european-leaders\">including Britain</a>, are welcome. They are right to insist that they, like Ukraine, must be part of any negotiations, to state their commitment to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to stress their willingness to enhance support. Mr Trump is abandoning Ukraine. Others would be both wrong and reckless to follow suit.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Article: <p>The picture painted by official data for the UK economy in 2024 reveals a country broken by 14&nbsp;years of Conservative party rule. True, the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/13/uk-economy-grows-by-01-in-unexpected-boost-for-rachel-reeves\">grew</a> – somewhat unexpectedly – but <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2025-02-13/uk-economy-grew-unexpectedly-at-the-end-of-last-year-but-living-standards-fall\">GDP per head</a> fell, showing prosperity didn’t reach most people. There are a few reasons for this decline but none suggests a healthy society. One is runaway wealth inequality, with gains hoarded at the top. Another is stark regional disparities, with some areas falling further behind despite national GDP rising. A third is rising immigration without enough job creation – more workers, but not enough well-paying positions.</p> <p>A growing economy means little if it doesn’t improve living standards. In 2024, it didn’t. This political reality has shaped recent years, and not in a good way. It’s worth recalling a Newcastle woman’s tart response to the political scientist Anand Menon in 2016 when he warned that Brexit would hit GDP: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/10/blunt-heckler-economists-failing-us-booming-britain-gdp-london\">“That’s your bloody GDP, not ours.”</a> That continuing frustration explains the current backlash against mainstream politicians. No wonder Sir&nbsp;Keir Starmer wants his party to be one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/08/the-farage-effect-why-keir-starmer-is-styling-labour-as-the-disruptors\">disruption</a>.</p> <p>Thursday’s growth figures offer the prime minister a chance to break the mould of British politics. Unfortunately, he seems reluctant to act. What’s clear from the statistics is that, in 2024, government spending drove growth – boosted by rising wages, especially in the public sector – rather than business investment or net trade. Labour could challenge the status quo with a new economic vision centred on the state. Instead, unfortunately, the government promotes the idea that growth depends on government inaction in the face of <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/regulators-may-be-cut-down-as-government-guns-for-growth-13308440\">unfettered capitalism</a>.</p> <p>Statistics often disguise the state’s role, framing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-economy-grows-by-01-q4-2024-2025-02-13/\">public services</a> as just another economic input rather than the engine of demand they are. This distortion makes the economy look more market-driven than reality, reinforcing neoliberal myths. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unfortunately, seems more eager to conform to these narratives than challenge them. She plans to cut <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/672b98bb40f7da695c921c61/Autumn_Budget_2024_Print.pdf\">public sector net borrowing</a> from March 2025 to meet fiscal rules – austerity by another name. The last time this happened, post-2010, it led to a decade of weak growth and stagnant wages. The justice secretary, <a href=\"https://rozenberg.substack.com/p/graylings-glittering-career\">Shabana Mahmood,</a> gets it. This week, she called out austerity’s role in wrecking probation services. If she was trying to change the chancellor’s mind, she deserves thanks. Britain can’t afford years of cuts.</p> <p>One of John Maynard Keynes’ <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch12.htm\">sharpest</a> insights was what’s good for society isn’t always good for profits. That’s why the <a href=\"https://green-alliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Next-stop-better-rail.pdf\">Green Alliance</a>, a thinktank, is right – injecting £3bn into discounting rail fares to boost passenger miles by 22% is smart economics. It’s a win for regional growth, for the climate and for cleaner air. The state has the power to make capitalism work for the public – if it chooses to use it. But Labour’s delay on releasing its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/12/labour-postpones-long-awaited-industrial-strategy\">industrial strategy</a> is a worrying sign.</p> <p>The UK must move away from a debt-driven, low-wage, financialised economic model. Public investment in infrastructure – especially in underserved regions – and in skills and industry is needed to stimulate demand and create high-quality jobs. Raising wages and reducing inequality will ensure broad-based prosperity, not just asset bubbles. The belief that <a href=\"https://politicalquarterly.org.uk/blog/rethinking-crowding-out-and-the-return-of-private-affluence-and-public-squalor/\">“markets know best”</a> has prevented bold action on Britain’s yawning economic divides and the climate emergency. After 40 years of weakening the state and rewarding rentier capitalism, reform is urgent. Labour must build a system that delivers it.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Dread of losing voters to Reform UK is driving the government into a familiar political trap\n",
      "Article: <p>One of Sir Keir Starmer’s first actions on becoming prime minister was to cancel the previous government’s scheme for deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda. It was the right decision for practical and ethical reasons. The Rwanda scheme was an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/22/failed-rwanda-deportation-scheme-cost-700m-says-yvette-cooper\">expensive failure</a> that put Britain in breach of international treaty obligations and promised to prolong the trauma of refugees.</p> <p>Labour’s alternative policy is contained in the border security, asylum and immigration bill that passed its second reading in the Commons this week. The <a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3929\">proposed law</a> creates new police powers to disrupt the traffic of small boats smuggling people across the Channel. A new border security command will have powers like those deployed in counter-terrorism operations.</p> <p>There is a valid rationale in focusing policy on the criminal gangs that run the illegal boat crossings – and put many lives in jeopardy in the process. And if that emphasis were matched with the creation of safe routes for people to seek asylum in Britain, the combination would start to look like a functional system – ruthless in shutting down the lethal route, humane in opening a legal one.</p> <p>But the second part of that proposition is absent. Worse, the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/11/uk-home-office-citizenship-refugees-dangerous-journey\">discreetly preserved</a> one of the egregiously uncharitable features of the junked&nbsp;Conservative policy. In guidance for assessment of naturalisation claims, the Home Office stipulates that applicants who have “made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship”. The fact of having come to Britain by unlawful means should, in the official Home Office view, mean disqualification&nbsp;under the test of whether a claimant is of “good character”.</p> <p>This implies that tens of thousands of people whose claims to asylum are recognised as legitimate and who, in some cases, have settled in the UK on that basis, are barred from becoming citizens. They will be trapped in an administrative no man’s land. This isn’t the same as the Conservative statute that barred small boat passengers from even making asylum claims in the UK – and thereby breached UN refugee conventions, which stipulate that entitlement to sanctuary is not conditional on the means of arrival in a safe haven. But there is now less divergence between the Labour and Tory approaches than was promised.</p> <p>The Conservatives justified their policy with a theory of deterrence. Withdrawing the prospect of asylum was supposed to discourage people from making the journey, although there was no evidence of any such effect. The undeclared motive was the hope that a performance of obstruction would appeal to voters who were abandoning the Tories for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. It looks as if Labour, facing a similar electoral challenge, has inherited the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/08/reform-uk-bearing-down-on-labour-as-voters-back-harder-line-on-migration\">same neurosis</a>.</p> <p>The Conservatives made bad policy that ramped up the salience of illegal migration as an issue without persuading anyone that their methods were sufficient to deal with it. Sir Keir is replicating that blunder. The error could be doubly costly. Reform will not be neutralised by yet more amplification of their favourite campaign themes by the Home Office, while many Labour supporters will be appalled. It might not be possible to design an asylum system that satisfies everyone, but one that is pragmatic and humane will garner more support than one that is neither. Sir Keir seemed to understand that in opposition. It is an insight he will regret abandoning in government.</p>\n",

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Spending public money carefully is a virtue in itself, but running down the public sector can cause huge problems later on\n",
      "Article: <p>Slash-and-burn government is back in vogue. Whether it is Elon&nbsp;Musk and his engineers taking the axe to US agency spending, the Conservative leader, Kemi&nbsp;Badenoch, wishing she had her own mini-Musk, or Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/08/the-farage-effect-why-keir-starmer-is-styling-labour-as-the-disruptors\">Keir Starmer</a> complaining about the “tepid bath of managed decline”, the complaint is that bureaucracy is bloated and needs to be cut down to size. <br>We’ve heard such charges before. For some it is ideologically driven: they believe that the state is inherently inefficient and that only businesspeople know how to make money count. For others it is prompted by the expansion of government in response to crises ultimately caused by state undercapacity, not overreach. They were wheeled out in the 2010s, after rich states stepped in to save the banks and prop up the economies. Then came the Covid pandemic, in which rich states stepped in to save employees (through such measures as furlough) and support businesses.</p> <p>Last time, it was David Cameron’s team who styled themselves as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/16/cameron-adviser-steve-hilton-leaves\">disruptors</a>” and brought in the businessman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/11/the-guardian-view-on-politicians-using-business-logic-public-services-arent-startups\">Philip Green as an “efficiency guru</a>”. This time it’s Donald Trump. Yet, measured as a proportion of all US workers, <a href=\"https://cepr.net/publications/federal-government-is-too-small/\">the US federal government workforce is smaller</a> than it was just after the second world war, when Mr Trump was born. And shifting its work to costlier private-sector operations has not been a boon.<br>One of the great parables of the consequences of an outsider hacking away at a complex organisation is contained in a history of Britain’s trashy cable channel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/may/15/broadcasting\">Live TV</a>. The authors, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Live_TV.html?id=A78VAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;redir_esc=y\">Chris Horrie and Adam&nbsp;Nathan</a>, give a picture of what happened when the lifelong print journalist Kelvin MacKenzie suddenly got to be boss. Not understanding many of the technicalities of television, he would apparently charge into the studio gallery while programmes were going out live and&nbsp;demand&nbsp;staff answer his questions. “Who are you? What do you do? … If you can’t tell me in&nbsp;20&nbsp;seconds … you’re out.” If the programme fell&nbsp;off&nbsp;air after they’d been given the boot, he would&nbsp;plead with them to come back. <br>Even Live TV’s viewers are unlikely to have been gravely distressed by its inadequacies. But government touches everyone’s lives, and in the most serious manner.</p> <p>“Efficiency” is not synonymous with frugality.&nbsp;Spending public money carefully is a virtue in itself, but running down the public sector&nbsp;can cause huge problems later on. As the <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj.q2624#:~:text=Jacqueline%20Carey%2C%20lead%20counsel%20for,not%20as%20good%20as%20normal.\">Covid inquiry</a> has shown, the pandemic hit an NHS that had been run too hot for too long – and so&nbsp;couldn’t cope when we most desperately needed&nbsp;it, in spite of the enormous efforts made by frontline staff and hospital managers. Who understands best which efficiencies make sense – those who work within an organisation, or someone who has seen its budget? <br>Not only is the public sector most essential when the private sector has failed, it is also usually among the most labour-intensive parts of the economy. And as the economist William&nbsp;Baumol&nbsp;famously showed, there is often a limit to how much productivity can be squeezed out of labour-intensive operations. Playing a piece written by Mozart for a string quartet will require four musicians in 2025, just as it did in 1925. You could speed it up, but neither players nor listeners would gain. As societies grow richer, older and more complex, they will grow bigger public sectors and they’ll need funding. That’s not always waste. Often, it should be counted as progress.</p>\n",

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The government should not stand aloof as a crisis unfolds in our universities. A new settlement is needed\n",
      "Article: <p>In one of David Lodge’s famous campus novels, a young English literature lecturer pictures her university as “the ideal human community, where … people were free to pursue excellence and self‑fulfilment, each according to their own rhythm and inclination”. A non-academic friend comments wryly: “Well, it’s nice work if you can get it.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/20/fiction.davidlodge\">Nice Work</a> was written in 1988, in part as a fictional response to the Thatcher cuts to higher education at the time. It’s safe to say a contemporary equivalent would need a different title. Forty years on, universities&nbsp;like to sell themselves along the lines of Robyn Penrose’s romantic vision. But the marketised reality for modern university staff, particularly those at&nbsp;the sharp end of a deepening funding crisis, is another world altogether.</p> <p>As the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/feb/01/quarter-of-leading-uk-universities-cutting-staff-due-to-budget-shortfalls\">reported</a> this month, almost a quarter of universities – including prestigious Russell Group institutions such as Durham and Cardiff – are taking a scythe to budgets and planning to shed staff. The Office for Students (OFS), the university regulator established in 2017, has <a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/news-blog-and-events/press-and-media/bold-and-transformative-action-needed-to-address-financial-sustainability-ofs/\">predicted</a> that 72% of higher education providers in England could be in the red by 2025-26. Up to 10,000 redundancies or job losses are in prospect. The Royal College of Nursing has warned that nursing courses are&nbsp;being “engulfed” by the cuts, even as the care sector seeks to fill 40,000 vacancies. Arts and humanities subjects are also in the line of fire.</p> <p>Airily, the OFS is calling for more of the same, recommending “bold and transformative action … while continuing to deliver for the students of today and tomorrow”. Easy to say, extremely hard to do. But what about the poor bloody infantry?</p> <p>Demoralised university staff, whose pay has been <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/11830/University-staff-pay-cut-by-20-new-figures-show#:~:text=The%20scale%20of%20pay%20cuts,pay%20cut%20as%20'fair'.\">declining</a> steeply in real terms, are not responsible for the dysfunctional <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/university-finances-are-in-a-perilous-state-its-the-result-of-market-competition-and-debt-based-expansion-234862#:~:text=Marketisation%20began%20with%20the%20introduction,while%20government%20grants%20were%20cut.\">marketisation</a> of higher education, which is at the root of today’s financial black hole. Successive Conservative governments are, having failed to foresee how treacherous the politics of raising tuition fees would be. Nor did academics have anything to do with the decision to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tough-government-action-on-student-visas-comes-into-effect\">impose</a> visa restrictions on high-fee‑paying foreign students, which has compounded the problem. Yet it is they who must bear the brunt of Westminster’s cumulative mistakes, in the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9e2xw9p8po\">form</a> of acute job insecurity, insufficient resources, pressures from panicked managers and&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;untenable workloads.</p> <p>As one vice-chancellor rightly told the Guardian, this unfolding crisis is largely passing under the radar. The drip-drip nature of the bad news being delivered on campuses up and down the country is relentless but dispersed. That does not make it any less stressful for those attempting to fill gaps in teaching left by departed colleagues, or for a thirtysomething humanities lecturer wondering whether, after years of impoverished study, their job will even see them into middle age.</p> <p>At present, Labour is doing little to help. In November, Bridget Phillipson <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0gjyj4979o\">announced</a> that the&nbsp;annual tuition fees cap would go up in line with&nbsp;inflation from April, the first rise for eight years. A £285 rise to £9,535 will modestly increase&nbsp;the debts of individual students, while doing little to address the overall problem. A new settlement is desperately needed – one that properly restores a sector that delivers a public good&nbsp;to the public realm. And which enables a sense&nbsp;of professional vocation, for&nbsp;those who work&nbsp;within it, to be renewed.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> MPs are right to push for health service improvements. But it is unclear what recent attacks on Amanda Pritchard will achieve\n",
      "Article: <p>It was presumably a coincidence that last month’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/29/complacent-health-chiefs-in-england-lack-drive-to-transform-nhs-say-mps\">highly critical report</a> on NHS finances from the House of Commons public accounts committee (PAC) was published just hours before Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s chief executive, appeared before the health and social care committee. The <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5901/cmselect/cmpubacc/350/report.html\">report</a> accused leaders at the organisation and the Department of Health and Social Care of lacking “drive” and “ideas”. That same day, immediately after Ms Pritchard’s evidence, the health committee issued a statement. Echoing the PAC,&nbsp;it said Ms Pritchard and her team lacked “drive” and “dynamism”.</p> <p>NHS England hit back at the PAC, claiming that MPs <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/01/nhs-england-response-to-flawed-pac-report/\">did not fully understand</a> the financial processes at issue. Wes Streeting was reported to have “full confidence” in Ms Pritchard, making it clear that her job is not on the line. But this two-pronged attack must have stung. While critical reports like the PAC’s are part and parcel of parliamentary scrutiny, it is highly unusual for public servants to be rebuked for their oral evidence.</p> <p>Even Ms Pritchard’s admirers would not claim that presentation is her strongest suit. The frustration of MPs on the health committee at what they regarded as long-winded answers was obvious to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF3cFrnF1HQ\">anyone watching</a>. But Ms Pritchard is not a politician, and one reason for a lack of clarity in her answers was that the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/30/nhs-england-told-to-scrap-improvement-pledges-and-prioritise-cutting-waiting-times\">crucial guidance</a>, including updated targets, had been postponed by ministers.</p> <p>While MPs, like voters, are understandably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/31/the-guardian-view-on-labours-nhs-reform-structural-change-while-slashing-waiting-lists-is-a-big-ask\">impatient for improvement</a>, the expectations of the people with operational responsibility for the health service should be realistic. Given funding constraints, and the fact that NHS England’s structure (with its 42 integrated care boards) is still bedding in, it is unclear what demands for transformation really mean – beyond a wish that things were better than they are. Julian Kelly, Ms Pritchard’s deputy, explained that most of the £10.6bn increase to the organisation’s budget in 2025-26 will be absorbed by salary and national insurance rises, inflation and the £3.5bn allowed for rising costs caused by an ageing population and new treatments.</p> <p>With a government desperate for progress, and under a high-profile and ambitious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/04/nhs-diversity-dei-practices-hindered-misguided-approaches-wes-streeting\">health secretary</a>, political pressure on the NHS will rise further. The PAC report raised concerns about productivity targets. On Monday, the Office for National Statistics published data <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c03473b-3fe7-4c98-a323-3346457aa408\">showing a decline</a> in the last quarter of 2024, contradicting NHS England’s claims. These conflicting findings, which are produced by different methodologies, are a concern in themselves.</p> <p>Sorting out this confusion should be a priority for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/02/new-top-civil-servant-chris-wormald-is-safe-pair-of-hands-but-devoid-of-charisma\">new permanent secretary</a> of Mr Streeting’s department, who is due to be appointed shortly, along with a new chair of NHS England. The filling of these two vacant posts means Ms Pritchard is likely to find she has less room to manoeuvre; the high level of autonomy granted to NHS England by the Conservatives is in the process of being reduced.</p> <p>This is not the only power struggle taking place. Another dynamic sees integrated care boards – with their duties to improve public health in partnership with councils – competing with big <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/04/all-nhs-acute-hospital-trusts-in-england-are-missing-labours-18-week-target\">hospital trusts</a> for influence and resources. One view of Ms Pritchard’s difficulties is that she is caught in the middle.</p> <p>Holding public sector bosses accountable is the job of MPs and they are right to take it seriously. But undermining NHS leaders also carries&nbsp;risks. Politicians should be mindful of strengths as well as&nbsp;weaknesses.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That agreement between the three nations explicitly bans tariff hikes beyond what was agreed. Yet, on his return to the White House, Mr Trump immediately threatened steep levies on goods from Canada and Mexico – the US’s key allies – retreating only after they made token <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fentanyl-czar-border-security-1.7452829\">concessions</a> on drugs and illegal immigration.

The bottom line is the US is breaking its word. Friends, such as the EU and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/10/gold-hits-record-high-as-trump-announces-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminium\">UK</a>, as well as opponents like <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg8zg7ll09o\">China</a> are also under threat.

While rival <a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/brics-pay-challenge-swift-network\">parallel</a> systems are emerging, nothing yet seriously challenges US dominance. But Mr Trump’s talk of American strength through isolation obfuscates his immediate political objective: to repackage corporate power as economic populism. Mr Trump sells tariffs as a shield against globalisation, claiming to protect workers – while actually boosting Wall Street profits. Most wealthy nations – including the US – used <a href=\"https://archive.ph/rBu3R\">industrial policies</a>, export subsidies and tariffs to build their economies before shifting to consumption-driven growth. The US went the furthest in this regard, hollowing out its industries to a far greater extent than <a href=\"https://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/CP132.pdf\">Germany and Japan</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-china-growth-limits-shifting-to-a-post-industrial-economy-is-tough\">China</a> has yet to fully shift toward a consumption-driven economy. Yet Mr Trump has convinced many Americans that globalisation alone fuelled China’s rise at their expense – a deliberate distortion. It is true that imports from China cost <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/growing-china-trade-deficits-costs-us-jobs/\">3.7m</a> US jobs, mostly in manufacturing. But that’s a tiny fraction of the 170-million-strong US workforce. Since 1970, US <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/imports\">imports</a> as a share of GDP have risen from 5% to 15%, yet inflation-adjusted per capita GDP has <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?end=2023&amp;amp;locations=US&amp;amp;start=1970\">tripled</a>.</p> <p>Globalisation proved a golden age for the few not the many.

Mr Trump’s biggest first-term policy win was a <a href=\"https://robertreich.substack.com/p/the-taxing-difference\">$1.9tn tax cut</a> – a giveaway to millionaires and corporations. But it was temporary and set to expire this year.

But, so far, Mr Trump’s tariff threats are mostly political theatre. He postures as tough on trade while his main policy goal is to keep funnelling wealth to the elite through pursuing trickle-down economics on steroids. The US didn’t lose to globalisation – it was sabotaged from within. Politicians, especially <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/tariff-man-2-0/id1584397047?i=1000689938995\">Republicans</a>, rigged the system to serve capital over labour.

      "Article: <p>Seventeen years after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, its future remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/09/kosovo-goes-to-the-polls-as-the-shadow-of-trump-looms-large\">shadowed</a> and compromised by relations with Belgrade. More than a decade of normalisation talks have so far been a road to nowhere, stymied principally by Serbia’s refusal to recognise its former territory’s right to the attributes of nationhood. In the country’s four northern Serb-majority municipalities, the deadlock has occasionally turned <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/24/europe/kosovo-shootout-police-officer-dead-intl/index.html\">deadly</a> as Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, has attempted to enforce sovereignty, resisted by Belgrade-backed rebels.</p> <p>There are tentative grounds for hoping that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/10/kosovo-elections-ruling-vetevendosje-party-loses-majority-initial-results-show\">outcome</a> of Kosovo’s latest election on Sunday, in which Mr Kurti’s ruling party came first but lost its majority, can deliver a route out of this impasse. Mr Kurti’s understandable but sometimes heavy-handed moves to demonstrate Pristina’s control over the north – such as imposing ethnic Albanian mayors after a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/serbs-north-kosovo-boycott-local-elections-2023-04-23/\">mass election boycott</a> by ethnic Serbs – have been strongly criticised by both the European Union and the US. On the eve of the poll, Richard Grenell, the newly appointed US special envoy for special missions, <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/07/new-trump-administrations-sudden-involvement-bewilders-kosovo-ahead-of-elections\">said</a> that relations between Washington and Pristina had “never been lower”.</p> <p>Meanwhile the EU has imposed sanctions that have so far cost one of the poorest and smallest nations in Europe about €150m (£125m). The prospect of a new coalition government in Pristina opens up the possibility of a less intransigent and more pragmatic approach. Both main opposition parties <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/why-the-eu-should-use-kosovos-election-to-advance-its-goals-in-the-western-balkans/\">campaigned</a> on the need to improve relations with western partners, and anxiety over Kosovo’s isolation at a perilous geopolitical moment was one of the election’s major themes. If the new Kurti administration can move beyond sometimes strident nationalist rhetoric and get Brussels and Washington&nbsp;back onside, that will be overwhelmingly in Kosovo’s&nbsp;interest.</p> <p>The goal should be the belated implementation of a 2023 normalisation <a href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15268.doc.htm\">agreement</a>, which theoretically obliged Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, to recognise Kosovo’s nationhood, in exchange for semi-autonomous powers for ethnic Serbs in the north. But getting there will require Mr Vučić, who has constantly fanned the flames of ethnic tension, to cease playing to his own nationalist gallery and finally sign the deal.</p> <p>Brussels should respond to any conciliatory steps from Pristina with alacrity and generosity. It takes two to create a deadlock, but while one of the tiniest and most vulnerable nations in Europe has been punished by sanctions, its large, bullying and hostile neighbour has not, for reasons of regional realpolitik. Given the obvious and ominous precedent of Ukraine, Mr Kurti’s fears over Belgrade’s ultimate agenda in Kosovo’s north are entirely comprehensible. They will be compounded by the memory of Donald Trump’s previous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/09/kosovo-goes-to-the-polls-as-the-shadow-of-trump-looms-large\">back</a>ing of a plan which at one stage included Kosovo’s partition.</p> <p>The EU has a new foreign affairs chief in the former Estonian prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/28/kaja-kallas-estonian-pm-josep-borrell-successor-eu\">Kaja Kallas</a>, and a new special envoy for Kosovo and Serbia normalisation in the Danish diplomat <a href=\"https://euronews.al/en/sorensen-officially-confirmed-as-envoy-for-kosovo-serbia-dialogue/\">Peter Sørensen</a> – a regional specialist. Britain’s new special envoy to the region, Karen Pierce, was ambassador to the US for five years. That offers the opportunity for a fresh start in relation to a country that has established a well-functioning democracy in the most challenging of contexts. Kosovo’s next government needs to be more pragmatic and less driven by Mr Kurti’s “you’re with us or against us” brand of nationalism. But the west must do more than just meet it halfway.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Title: The Guardian view on interest rates: the Bank of England on its own won’t revive growth\n",
      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> Base rate cuts may ease borrowing costs but without stronger public spending and targeted tax relief, economic stagnation will persist\n",
      "Article: <p>“It will be welcome news to many that we have been able to cut interest rates again,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/06/bank-of-england-lowers-uk-interest-rates\">said</a> Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, last week. Plenty of mortgage holders would agree. Savers might not share Mr Bailey’s sentiments. However, he justified the cut, made despite inflationary risks, by arguing that falling worker bargaining power would see price pressures subside. Without rate cuts, the Bank warned, there was&nbsp;the risk of anaemic economic growth.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backed the Bank, <a href=\"https://x.com/RachelReevesMP/status/1887489021258973197\">saying</a> its action would “ease cost of living pressures”. That is true, but the benefits of lowering the burden of borrowing won’t outweigh the costs of Ms Reeves’ fiscal choices. She is counting on up to <a href=\"https://x.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1883090237024239754\">six base rate cuts</a> by mid-2026 to buoy consumer sentiment. But relying solely on monetary policy is not effective economic management.</p> <p>The former Tory prime minister Edward Heath once <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/historic_moments/newsid_8195000/8195546.stm\">mocked</a> the then-chancellor Nigel Lawson for being a “one-club golfer” stuck in a bunker. “He doesn’t know what to do and has therefore very wisely decided to do nothing,” Mr Heath quipped. Many holes have been played on the parliamentary green since, but the&nbsp;critique still holds.</p> <p>Ms Reeves is betting that steeply declining borrowing costs will have an immediate impact on businesses and households in a way that capital investment – the core of the chancellor’s “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/06/unambiguously-bleak-bank-of-england-forecasts-lay-way-for-spending-cuts\">plan for growth</a>” – never could. Low interest rates alone won’t end stagnation. Between the financial crisis and the pandemic, the UK kept interest rates at <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/Bank-Rate.asp\">historic</a> lows. Yet <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/ihyp/pn2\">economic growth</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.london.gov.uk/blog/the-impact-of-rising-interest-rates-and-financial-turbulence-on-londons-economy/\">productivity</a> remained lower than in the preceding decade – though Brexit didn’t help. Cheaper borrowing failed to spark robust <a href=\"https://data.london.gov.uk/blog/uk-investment-between-2000-2019-distinction-with-a-difference/\">investment</a> and high levels of <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/onshouseholdexpendituredatainsightsintotheeffectsofcostsoflivingpressures/4december2023\">consumer confidence</a>.</p> <p>The reason is that businesses and households often use lower rates to pay off debt rather than taking on new loans. This is especially true in a sluggish economy – people prefer saving over spending. As John Maynard Keynes <a href=\"https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/texts/keynes/keynes1937qje.htm\">argued</a>, in uncertain times, firms and individuals hoard cash, undermining the intended effects of monetary easing. Even if firms face lower borrowing costs, they won’t invest unless they see demand rising. The problem isn’t access to cheap credit – it’s weak demand.</p> <p>Stagnant growth this year stems from insufficient fiscal stimulus. Much of the government’s <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/timeseries/dzls/pusf\">borrowing</a> is likely just offsetting capital outflows due to the <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn02815/\">trade deficit</a>, rather than adding to private sector spending power. To boost growth, a larger fiscal deficit is needed. That could come through higher public spending. Or it might be through fiscal reliefs for, say, green investment. It could also be achieved by tax cuts targeted at lower-income households, who are far more likely to spend than save.</p> <p>Yet the Treasury wants public sector net borrowing to decline from 2025-26, to return “<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/672b98bb40f7da695c921c61/Autumn_Budget_2024_Print.pdf\">inflation sustainably to target</a>”. This is not, as the Bank says, a concern. Constraining government spending will cut growth – growth that ministers say is their <a href=\"https://www.itn.co.uk/news/starmer-insists-growth-governments-number-one-priority-0\">top priority</a>. Ms Reeves’s real test comes in 2026-27 when spending cuts and tax hikes kick in to meet self-imposed <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/current-fiscal-rules\">fiscal rules</a>. Labour MPs, councillors and activists must lobby her to rethink. Rather than prioritising deficit reduction, Ms&nbsp;Reeves should boost spending on public services and <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/governments-80-employment-rate-target-lessons-history-and-abroad\">job creation</a> – ensuring fiscal policy aids, not hinders, economic wellbeing. The last decade showed clearly that low rates alone won’t deliver growth. Without an active fiscal policy, Britain risks remaining trapped in Mr Heath’s proverbial bunker.</p>\n",

      "Subheading: <strong>Editorial:</strong> The problem is getting worse, while the last government’s strategy has little to show for it. Ministers should go back to basics\n",
      "Article: <p>For anyone involved in the government’s strategy to combat violence against women, the National Audit Office’s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/31/violence-against-women-girls-epidemic-uk\">report</a> must have felt like a bucket of cold water. This is a societal problem that plenty of evidence suggests is getting worse rather than better – though inconsistent data is itself a challenge and makes firm conclusions tricky.</p> <p>The prevalence of sexual assault against women in England and Wales is estimated to have risen from 3.4% of the population to 4.3% between 2009‑10 and 2023‑24. Over the same period the number of reported&nbsp;rapes and sexual assaults rose around fourfold – a change only partly explained by improved recording. Violence against women and girls now accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/tackling-violence-against-women-and-girls/\">20% of all crime</a>, despite an estimated reduction in the prevalence of domestic violence (from 9.2% to 7.4%). Digital technology has&nbsp;created opportunities for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/15/girlguiding-study-reveals-shocking-impact-of-online-abuse-on-girls\">new kinds of offending</a> –&nbsp;and left lawmakers struggling to keep up.</p> <p>A report last year led to police being issued deadlines to produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/27/stalking-victims-left-at-serious-risk-by-police-failures-report-finds\">action plans on stalking</a>. New offences relating to the creation and sharing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/07/labour-to-make-taking-intimate-images-without-consent-a-criminal-offence\">intimate images</a> and sexually explicit deepfakes will be included in a crime bill that is expected soon. But the wider question of how ministers plan to meet their own hugely ambitious target, of halving violence against women and girls (VAWG) in a decade, is waiting for an answer.</p> <p>The NAO’s damning verdict on the Home Office’s existing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-violence-against-women-and-girls-strategy\">strategy</a> will not make this any easier – except in as much as it allows ministers to blame the last government for a dire situation. According to the report, assessing progress is made difficult by the retrospective addition to the strategy of a “theory of change” that was devised as part of a separate domestic abuse plan. The Home Office told the NAO that it doesn’t know what impact either plan has had on offending. A ministerial group set up to oversee implementation met just four times between 2021 and 2024. The home secretary attended only once.</p> <p>Even more dismaying, given that prevention is among the strategy’s main aims, is the report’s finding that, despite spending £4.2m since 2021 on research, the government is in the dark regarding what works. These studies have yet to provide “significant insights”, with some projects still incomplete. While results are expected to feed into policymaking in future, the Home Office says that lack of evidence is an international problem.</p> <p>Preventing harm is an important goal of criminal justice policy, as it is in health. But given this lack of information, it makes sense to refocus on tried‑and‑tested services. Council-funded victim support and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/18/uk-charities-warn-of-devastating-council-cuts-to-womens-services\">women’s refuges</a> are chronically underfunded, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/dec/06/crisis-courts-england-wales-how-did-we-get-here\">courts</a> have seen some of the deepest public sector cuts. Ministers should commit to rebuilding these crucial foundations of the VAWG sector, and improving criminal justice outcomes.</p> <p>Increasing funding for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/the-observer-view-on-domestic-abuse---thousands-of-women-in-england-and-wales-refused-refuge\">voluntary-sector women’s groups</a> might sound less appealing than stopping men from abusing their partners in the first place. But for now a policy focused on the needs of victims and survivors would send a powerful message. One thing the old strategy had right was its recognition that action must be coordinated across departments. Yvette Cooper at the Home Office, Shabana Mahmood at the Ministry of Justice, and Angela&nbsp;Rayner at the department for local government could together lead a shift at the top of government. They should approach VAWG pragmatically, by restoring vital support to those affected.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Subheading: Seven years on from the London fire, half a million people are still estimated to be living in dangerous buildings\n",
      "Article: <p>The remains of Grenfell Tower have for the last seven years stood as a testament to the worst British fire disaster in living memory. They have become a permanent feature of the west London skyline; one that means the people who live and work in north Kensington – including those who survived the fire – are never far away from the reminder that 72 people died, and that this terrible loss of life was entirely avoidable were it not for a series of dreadful failures by the public bodies, private companies and regulators responsible for ensuring the safety of its residents.</p> <p>The question of what should happen to the tower was always going to be highly sensitive. Some survivors and family members desperately want it to remain standing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/06/grenfell-tower-demolition-would-risk-fire-being-forgotten-some-survivors-say\">as a memorial to those who were killed</a>. Nabil Choucair, who lost six family members, says it should at least be allowed to stand until the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07k2g5010go\">criminal investigation </a>– still ongoing – has concluded. There are some local residents who say they find its continuing presence difficult and who worry about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07k2g5010go\">whether it is structurally safe</a>, following engineers’ reports that have said that the tower needs to be taken down above its 10th floor for safety reasons.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, deputy prime minister Angela Rayner told a community meeting that the tower would be dismantled entirely after the eighth anniversary of the fire, to be replaced by a memorial that could incorporate elements of it. The government rejected suggestions from some survivors that the lower levels should be allowed to stand, arguing this would be unfair to those with a connection to flats on the upper levels that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwxpnxyrnvo\">have to be removed</a>. Grenfell United, which represents some survivors and family members, has been highly critical of the way the government has handled the decision process; another survivor group, Grenfell Next of Kin, attributed the best of intentions to Rayner.</p> <p>It is understandable and to be expected that some relatives find the prospect of the tower being taken down extremely painful, particularly given the fact that no one has yet been held criminally responsible for the fire; the outcome of any criminal trials is not expected until a full decade after it happened. Given this decision has now been made by the government, it remains critical that the <a href=\"https://www.grenfelltowermemorial.co.uk/about-us\">Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission</a> – itself mainly made up of elected representatives from the community – continues to engage with families and survivors with a range of views about what form the memorial should take.</p> <p>At the time the final report of the public inquiry was published, the government promised it would produce its response to the inquiry’s recommendations within six months; that response is due by early March. After a National Audit Office report last November called on the government to speed up the pace of remedial work on <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dangerous-cladding-the-governments-remediation-portfolio-summary.pdf\">buildings with dangerous cladding</a> – seven years on from the fire, only a third of tower blocks have had the cladding removed, and half a million people are estimated to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmnw248222o\">live in dangerous buildings</a> – ministers announced plans to bring forwards the deadline for buildings over 11 metres to be fixed or have a date in place for completion to the end of 2029. But that is still almost <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmnw248222o\">five years away</a>. And the government will need to undertake radical reform of the construction industry to avoid another lethal fire: the inquiry recommended setting up a new public regulator, with a single line of ministerial responsibility, to oversee building construction, including licensing companies involved in the construction of higher-risk buildings. Such a scheme will be expensive, but it is of paramount importance that the resources are found.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And yet, less than three weeks into Donald Trump’s second term, it is barely controversial to many people looking on from shell-shocked democracies beyond America’s shores. By his destructive, vindictive, illegal and irrational actions, Trump sets himself beyond the pale. In place of American exceptionalism, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trump-viktor-orban-electoral-autocracy\">world must now learn</a> to manage, and if necessary confront, a gross American objectionablism.</p> <p>Proof of these assertions is to be found in the White House’s daily outpourings. Seeking revenge against those who tried to punish his attempted 6 January 2021 electoral coup, Trump is weaponising the justice department by executive order. Political opponents, FBI agents, prosecutors, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/media/politico-news-subscriptions-white-house.html\">media outlets and journalists</a> are in his sights. In contrast, about 1,500 convicted Capitol Hill rioters have been pardoned.

To this end, he has recruited the sycophantic billionaire, Elon Musk,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/musk-doge-aides.html\"> and teams of youthful, unaccountable acolytes</a> to physically take over offices and computer systems, suspend, lock out or sack civil servants and seize control of programmes and budgets. The treasury, the education department, the federal election commission and independent government watchdogs are all under the hammer wielded, principally, by Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”. Nor has the CIA and the wider “intelligence community” escaped Trump’s vendetta. It, too, faces mass firings under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/30/tulsi-gabbard-confirmation-hearing\">proposed leadership</a> of Tulsi Gabbard, a Russia apologist.

He has demanded a halt to the rollout of EV charging stations, declared open season on wildlife and the environment by relaxing oil and gas drilling regulations, and withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement. He even wants to ban paper straws, preferring plastic. From an immediate international perspective, Trump’s decision to eviscerate USAid, the world’s biggest foreign aid provider, and the attempted sacking of nearly all its staff, is the most savagely objectionable misdeed of all.</p> <p>His freezing of USAid’s $42.8bn (£34.5bn) budget spells death or renewed suffering for millions of dependent people, from Sudan to Bangladesh to Ukraine. The US accounts for about $4 in every $10 spent globally on humanitarian aid. To the instant human toll, as Britain’s former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/07/donald-trump-elon-musk-usaid-poverty-america\">Gordon Brown points out</a>, must be added a loss of US global influence that will benefit authoritarian rivals China and Russia. “The era when American leaders valued their soft power is coming to an end,” Brown wrote.

His on-off tariff wars with China, Canada and, prospectively, the EU; his militarisation of migration policy along the US border with Mexico; his imperialistic vow to seize Greenland by force from Nato ally Denmark; and his disdain for the UN, typified by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c391j738rm3o\">his withdrawal from the World Health Organization</a> and the UN Human Rights Council, are all decisions underscoring his broader contempt for the multilateralist, rules-based international order. Nothing more damningly illustrates that contempt than yet another outrageous executive order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/trump-sanction-icc\">sanctioning the international criminal court</a> (ICC).</p> <p>Trump’s ICC attack was prompted in part by a wish to protect Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister and court-indicted war crimes suspect, who was feted at the White House last week. He used this occasion to unveil his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/06/trump-gaza-power-trip-denying-palestinian-state\">most absurd, most dangerous idea</a> to date: a forcible “clean-out” of the 2 million inhabitants of Gaza and a US-owned “Riviera” real estate development amid the ruins of their Palestinian homeland. This wheeze is too ignorant, too insulting and too inhumane to be taken entirely seriously. Yet that has not stopped Israeli and US rightwingers using it as potential justification for wrecking the ceasefire, resuming the war and laying the ground for annexations in Gaza and the West Bank.</p> <p>Trump, the convicted felon, proves each day that he is unfit for the high office he holds. He aims to destroy the fundamentals of American democracy: the separation of powers, civil and voting rights, secularism, free speech and equality under the law. He is a menace to global peace, stability and prosperity. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdd9p8g405no\">Pushback has begun</a>, largely through the courts. Yet a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/08/judge-temporarily-blocks-musks-doge-team-from-accessing-treasury-records\">few defiant judges</a> cannot win this huge, rapidly developing struggle. The Democrats, stunned into virtual silence, must wake up. Meanwhile, Britain and the western democracies must take a united stand. So far, Keir Starmer and his ministers have been too circumspect. They must be bolder and braver in their criticism and in upholding British values.</p> <p>The rise of Trump and like-minded far-right populists, lawless bullies and anti-democratic autocrats around the world is the great challenge of our age. Trump the objectionable is setting the world on fire.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      " amid all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the last half century, we have witnessed nothing short of a miracle. it is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59 between 1990 and 2022. it has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants, since the expanded programme on immunisation was launched by the world health organization in 1974. initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. then, in 2000, came the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation gavi, a publicprivate organisation that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs. robert f kennedy jr  who once claimed that no vaccine is safe and effective and who tried to persuade the us government to rescind authorisation for the coronavirus vaccine at the height of the pandemic  was confirmed this week as health secretary. now the uk, one of gavis founding donors and the country which has given most to its core programme, is considering a significant cut to its support. while some aspects of gavis approach have faced sensible scrutiny in the past, it has vaccinated over 1 billion children and done so costeffectively 97 pence in every pound it is given goes on vaccine programmes.\n",

      " amid all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the last half century, we have witnessed nothing short of a miracle. it is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59 between 1990 and 2022. it has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants, since the expanded programme on immunisation was launched by the world health organization in 1974. initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. then, in 2000, came the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation gavi, a publicprivate organisation that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs. robert f kennedy jr  who once claimed that no vaccine is safe and effective and who tried to persuade the us government to rescind authorisation for the coronavirus vaccine at the height of the pandemic  was confirmed this week as health secretary. now the uk, one of gavis founding donors and the country which has given most to its core programme, is considering a significant cut to its support. while some aspects of gavis approach have faced sensible scrutiny in the past, it has vaccinated over 1 billion children and done so costeffectively 97 pence in every pound it is given goes on vaccine programmes.\n",
